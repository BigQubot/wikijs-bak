# Introduction

The Banana Pi BPI-M1 is a business card-sized and low-power single-board computer featuring a high performance AllWinner A20 dual-core SoC at 1 GHz, 1 GB of DDR3 SDRAM, Gigabit Ethernet, SATA, USB, and HDMI connections. It can run a variety of operating systems including Android, Lubuntu, Ubuntu, Debian, and Raspbian.

It is the first open source hardware launched by the banana pie team, and also a classic product with the largest cumulative sales of banana pie.There are still a lot of business clients that apply to various projects.A20 chip

Banana Pi is an open platform device, it is for anyone who wants to play and build with developer technology instead of simply using consumer technology. Backed by our community, starting a project and building servers is fun and rewarding.
