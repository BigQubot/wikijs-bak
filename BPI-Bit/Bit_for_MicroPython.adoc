== Resources
We are now testing all micro:bit online documentation examples，we have let BPI:bit compatibility micro:bit function library，so，microPyton support for micro:bit，You can run it directly on BPI:bit.

This is BPI:Bit run:https://microbit-micropython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/hello.html code . You can run the code directly on BPI:bit, you can see the video demo.
