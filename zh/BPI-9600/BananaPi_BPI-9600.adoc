= Description

The BPI-9600 series of modules are designed to extract power from a conventional twisted pair Category 5 Ethernet cable, conforming to the IEEE 802.3af Power-over-Ethernet(PoE) standard. The BPI-9600 signature and control circuit provides the PoE compatibility signature and power classification required by the Power Sourcing Equipment (PSE) before applying up to 15W power to the port. The BPI-9600 provides a Class 0 signature.

The DC/DC converter operates over a wide input voltage range and provides a regulated output. The DC/DC converter also has built-in short-circuit output protection.

Note:

. With minimum load
. See Section Operating Temperature Range +
Extended use close to, or at the maximum operating temperature can reduce the life time of the device.

== DC Electrical Characteristics

Note:

. Typical figures are at 25°C with a nominal 48V supply and are for design aid only. Not Guaranteed
. The output ripple and noise can be reduced with an external filter, see application note.
. Continuous short circuit duration is applicable at 25'C ambient temperature in free air. At higher temperatures or with restricted
airflow (e.g. in a sealed enclosure) the duration will need to be limited to avoid overheating.
