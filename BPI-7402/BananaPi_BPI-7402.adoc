= Description

The BPI-7402 series of modules are designed to extract power from a conventional twisted pair Category 5 Ethernet cable, conforming to the IEEE 802.3af and IEEE 802.3at Power-over-Ethernet(PoE) standard.it is 30W POE PD Module ( Isolation Model),The BPI-7402 signature and control circuit provides the PoE compatibility signature and power classification required by the Power Sourcing Equipment (PSE) before applying up to 30W power to the port.

Note

. Typical figures are at 25°C with a nominal 48V supply and are for design aid only. Not Guaranteed
. The output ripple and noise can be reduced with an external filter, see application note.
. Continuous short circuit duration is applicable at 25'C ambient temperature in free air. At higher temperatures or with restricted
airflow (e.g. in a sealed enclosure) the duration will need to be limited to avoid overheating.

Note

. With minimum load
. See Section Operating Temperature Range +
Extended use close to, or at the maximum operating temperature can reduce the life time of the device.

== Power Classification
The BPI-7402 classification is fixed at Class 4, this means that an IEEE802.3at Type 1 or an IEEE802.3af PSE will default to Class 0. However an IEEE802.3at PSE will recognise the Class 4 as a Type 2 PD.

== AT Detection
AT-DET output pin which is used to detect a Two Event Physical Layer classification as described in IEEE802.3at. If required the AT-DET pin can be connected directly to an opto-coupler.

If the detects a Two Event Physical Layer classification, the (AT True) switch will close and Opto1 will turn ON. Opto1 will be connected across the isolation barrier and the output collector can be connected to a controller (with a pull-up resistor connected to the controller’s power rail). When Opto1 is ON the collector (output) will be Logic 0, the controller will then know that the PSE is capable of delivering over 15.4W. To complete the protocol the controller should then confirm that it is a Type 2 PD over the Data Link Layer.

If the detects a Single Event Physical Layer classification, Opto1 will be OFF and the output collector will be Logic 1 (via pull-up resistor). The controller should then assume that the PSE is limited to delivering up to 15.4W.

If the PSE does not support the Physical Layer classification, Opto1 will be OFF. The RT7402 will operate with non IEEE802.3at compliant POE+ PSE’s.

**Note: There are several PSEs (including Cisco) that will only delivery ≤15.4W until they receive Type 2 PD confirmation, over the Data Link Layer.**
