=== Install Image with Usb Download Tool
**Windows**

. Download and install Rockchip USB driver
+

**Linux**

. Download link:https://download.banana-pi.dev/d/ca025d76afd448aabc63/files/?p=%2FTools%2Fimage_download_tools%2FRK_Linux_Upgrade_Tool_v1.65.zip[Linux USB Download Tool], And install it into the system as follows commands:
+
```sh
 $ unzip Linux_Upgrade_Tool_xxxx.zip
 $ cd Linux_UpgradeTool_xxxx
 $ sudo mv upgrade_tool /usr/local/bin
 $ sudo chown root:root /usr/local/bin/upgrade_tool
 $ sudo chmod a+x /usr/local/bin/upgrade_tool
```
. Check the windows download processes, enter the right usb download mode and upgrade image firmware with this command:
+
```sh
 $ sudo upgrade_tool uf update.img
```
+
image::/picture/linux_download.png[linux_download.png]
. If the upgrade fails, try erasing the emmc and upgrade again.
+
```sh
 $ sudo upgrade_tool ef update.img
```
+
image::/picture/linux_erase.png[linux_erase.png]

+
```sh
# upgrade again
 $ sudo upgrade_tool uf update.img
```

=== Install Image with SD card

. Download link:https://download.banana-pi.dev/d/ca025d76afd448aabc63/files/?p=%2FTools%2Fimage_download_tools%2FRKSDDiskTool_v1.7.zip[Rockchip SD Disk Tool].
. Insert card reader to Windows PC, 8GB sdcard size at least.
. Run SD_Firmware_Tool, check the “**Upgrade Firmware**” box and select the correct removable disk device, Choose firmware image, then Click Create button to make it and wait until it is finshed
+
image::/picture/r2-pro_sd-1.jpg[r2-pro_sd-1.jpg]
. Safely remove the microSD card, insert it into the R2pro board, power on the board, it will start upgrading automatically.
+
image::/picture/sd_upgrade.png[sd_upgrade.png]

. After the upgrade, you can see the following info on screen, remove the microSD card and the board will restart automatically to complete the whole process of firmware update.
+
image::/picture/sd_upgrade_finish.png[sd_upgrade_finish.png]

=== Boot Android from SDcard
Create a sdcard for android boot is almost the same as create a firmware upgrade sdcard, only one difference is select "SD Boot" mode instead of "Upgrade Firmware". This process lasts about 8 minutes, then safely remove the SDcard, insert it into the r2pro board and power on.

One thing to note is that make sure emmc is empty, you must erase it if flashed before. We recommend that use emmc for android boot because it is faster and more stable.

=== Build Android Source Code
. Get Android source code
+
```sh
 $ git clone https://github.com/BPI-SINOVOIP/BPI-Rockchip-Android11 --depth=1
```
or you can get the source code tar archive from link:https://pan.baidu.com/s/1c2vw-df4hh55VB3gSsM6Uw?pwd=8888[BaiduPan(pincode: 8888)] or link:https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_DkE_6dsTQ-HZoEDGdvFsYtf5_ARQXoh?usp=share_link[GoogleDrive]
. Build the Android Source code +
Please read the source code link:https://github.com/BPI-SINOVOIP/BPI-Rockchip-Android11/blob/master/README.md[README.md]

=== USB OTG Mode Switch
The top usb port is a usb 3.0 otg port, but without hw id pin, it only can be used as host or peripheral.The release image set host mode default, but you can change it in Settings

. Tablet variant image +
Settings->Connected devices->USB Connect to PC, switch on is peripheral mode and switch off is host mode.
+

R2Pro hw design only have one group TP io, CN7, CN8, CN9 are all connect to it, so only one interface Touch Screen can be used at the same time. you can enable or disable it in dtb
```sh
 &i2c1 {
         status = "okay"
 }
```

=== Custom Android Boot Logo
. prepare two bmp format files, logo.bmp for uboot logo and logo_kernel.bmp for kernel logo.
