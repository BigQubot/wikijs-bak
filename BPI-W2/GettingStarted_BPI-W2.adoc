```
. Install image with bpi-tools on Linux, plug SDcard to Linux PC and run
+
```sh
sudo apt-get install pv unzip
sudo bpi-copy xxx-bpi-w2-xxx.img.zip /dev/sdX
```

=== Install Image to eMMC

. Prepare a SDcard with Linux image flashed and bootup board with this SDcard.
. Unzip the image and copy it to a USB drive, plug the udisk to board and mount it.（If automatically mounted, ignore this step）
+
```sh
mount /dev/sdx /mnt
```
. There are two ways to install the linux image to board.
- Install with dd command.
+
```sh
sudo dd if=/mnt/xxx.bpi-w2-xxx.img of=/dev/mmcblk0 bs=10M status=noxfer
```
- Install the linux image in udisk with bpi-tools command
+
```sh
sudo bpi-copy xxx-bpi-w2-xxx.img.zip /dev/mmcblk0
```
. After download complete, power off safely and eject the SDcard.

```
- Mount sata
+
```sh

```

==== SSD
. After you success to insert SATA, we could input following commands to test SATA interface:
+
--
Test read speed
```sh
time dd if=/dev/xxx of=/dev/null bs=1M count=1000
```
Test write speed
```sh
time dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdx bs=1M count=1000
```
