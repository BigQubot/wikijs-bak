# Development
## Prepare
* Prepare 8G/above TF card, USB-Serial cable, Ubuntu System
* 12V/2A power adapter (without any peripherals, the power consumption of BPI-R4_Lite Main Board will not exceed 10W in the most extreme cases. but you need to determine whether you need a higher power power adapter according to your own accessory usage)
* Using your USB TypeC Debug Console
* link:                              [Download the image] to be burned
* Default IP address for LAN port: 192.168.1.1
* User name/password: pi/bananapi ,root/bananapi. +
Or the user is root without a password.
* WIFI: AP_MTK_MT7990_2G/AP_MTK_MT7990_5G/AP_MTK_MT7990_6G

## BPI-R4_Lite bootstrap and device select Jumper Setting:
![banana_pi_r4_lite_bootstrap.png](/bpi-r4_lite/banana_pi_r4_lite_bootstrap.png)
1. A/B/D Jumper is "0", BPI-R4_Lite will boot from SD card
2. A Jumper is "0" and B/C Jumper is "1", BPI-R4_Lite will boot from SPI NOR Flash
3. A Jumper is "1" and B/C Jumper is "0", BPI-R4_Lite will boot from SPI NAND Flash
4. A/B/D Jumper is "1",BPI-R4_Lite will boot from EMMC
5. If the console said "system halt!", it means that the bootup storage does not cotain any OS

## How to burn image to SD card.

- Please follow the following diagram for Windows PC.

                         image
- Linux PC, you can use the "**mksf**" command for formatting, or use the "**dd**" command to write zeros.
**Burn image to SD card on windows computer**
[Balena Etcher](https://balena.io/etcher) is an opensource GUI flash tool by Balena, Flash OS images to SDcard or USB drive.
- Click on "**Flash from file**" to select image. 
- Click on "**Select target**" to select USB device. 
- Click on "**Flash!**" Start burning.
                  image
                  
 **Burn image to SD card on linux computer**
1. You could download latest image from our forum     
2. Install bpi-tools on your Ubuntu. If you can't access this URL or any other problems, please go to bpi-tools repo and install this tools manually.
+
```sh
apt-get install pv
curl -sL https://github.com/BPI-SINOVOIP/bpi-tools/raw/master/bpi-tools | sudo -E bash
```
 After you download the image, insert your TF card into your Ubuntu. Execute

+
```sh
bpi-copy xxx.img /dev/sdx
```
to install image on your TF card

. After step 3, then you can insert your TF card into R4_Lite, and press power button to setup R4_Lite
 
**Change Boot Jumper to boot from SD, Enable SD Card Device.**

## How to burn image to onboard NOR
> When you want to Update Nand device, Firstly Change boot switch to boot from SD device and insert one SD with SD boot Image, then after boot up,you need flash one Nand image into Nor device. Finally you change bootstrap to boot from Nor device.
{.is-info}

Before burning image into Nand, please prepare a USB disk. Letâ€™s take OpenWrt image (mtk-bpi-r4lite-NOR.img ) for example, the steps are below:

1. Copy Nand boot OpenWrt image(**mtk-bpi-r4lite-NOR.img**) to USB disk. 
2. Change boot switch Jumper, the board boot from SD device, then power up the board.
3. Plug in USB disk to the board, and mount the USB to /mnt or other directory as follows: (you can skip mounting if it is mounted automatically)

+
```SH
mount -t vfat /dev/sda1 /mnt 
cd /mnt
```
4. Execute following command to erase the whole Nor flash and copy image to nor device:

+
```sh
mtd erase /dev/mtd0
dd if=mtk-bpi-r4lite-NOR.img of=/dev/mtdblock0
```
5. Power off BPI-R4_Lite board, unplug u-disk driver, change bootstrap to boot from Nand device.

## How to burn image to onboard Nand
> **NAND has an image burned at the factory. If you want to use it, simply switch to the corresponding boot and then power on to start.**

>  When you want to Update Nand device, Firstly Change boot switch to boot from SD device and insert one SD with SD boot Image, then after boot up,you need flash one Nand image into Nand device. Finally you change bootstrap to boot from Nand device.
{.is-info}


Before burning image into Nand, please prepare a USB disk. Let's take OpenWrt image (mtk-bpi-r4lite-NAND-2PCIe-1L.img) for example, the steps are below:

1. Copy Nand boot OpenWrt image(**mtk-bpi-r4lite-NAND-2PCIe-1L.img**) to USB disk. 
2. Change boot switch Jumper, the board boot from SD device, then power up the board.
3. Plug in USB disk to the board, and mount the USB to /mnt or other directory as follows: (you can skip mounting if it is mounted automatically)

+
```SH
mount -t vfat /dev/sda1 /mnt 
cd /mnt/sda1
```
4. Execute following command to erase the whole Nand flash and copy image to nand device:

+
```sh
mtd erase /dev/mtd0
mtd write mtk-bpi-r4lite-NAND-2PCIe-1L.img /dev/mtd0
```
. Power off BPI-R4_Lite board, unplug u-disk driver, change bootstrap to boot from Nand device.


## How to burn image to onboard eMMC
> Because SD card and EMMC device share one SOC's controller, it is necessary to switch to NAND startup and then burn the EMMC image into the EMMC. Finally, you will change the boot to boot from EMMC.
{.is-info}


Before burning image to eMMC, please prepare a USB disk. Let's take OpenWrt image (bl2_emmc.img, mtk-bpi-r4lite-EMMC-NAND.img) for example, the steps are below:

1. Copy EMMC boot OpenWrt image(**bl2_emmc-r4.img**,**mtk-bpi-r4-EMMC-20231030.img**) to USB disk, if the image is compressed please uncompress it before copying to USB disk.

2. Change the switch jumper to Nand and start the motherboard from Nand.
 
3. Plug in USB disk to the board, and mount the USB to /mnt or other directory as follows: (you can skip mounting if it is mounted automatically)

+
```sh
mount -t vfat /dev/sda1 /mnt 
cd /mnt/sda1
```

4. Execute :

+
```sh
echo 0 > /sys/block/mmcblk0boot0/force_ro
dd if=bl2_emmc.img of=/dev/mmcblk0boot0
dd if=mtk-bpi-r4lite-EMMC-NAND.img of=/dev/mmcblk0
mmc bootpart enable 1 1 /dev/mmcblk0
sync
sync
```
 
. Power off R4_Lite board, remove u-disk driver, change bootstrap to boot from emmc device.
