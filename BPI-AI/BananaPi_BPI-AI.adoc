== About Kendryte K210 chip

The Kendryte K210 is a system-on-chip (SoC) that integrates machine vision and machine hearing. 

Using TSMC’s ultra-low-power 28nm advanced process with dual-core 64-bit processors for better power performance, stability and reliability. 

The program strives for zero threshold development and can be deployed in the user’s products in the shortest time, giving the product artificial intelligence.

The Kendryte K210 is located in the SoC of the AI and IoT markets and is a very convenient MCU.

Kendryte Chinese means surveying intelligence, while surveying intelligence is taken from surveying and searching. 

The main application field of this chip is in the field of Internet of Things, and it is developed in the field of Internet of Things. 

Therefore, this chip mainly provides artificial intelligence solutions, which are explored in the field of artificial intelligence.
