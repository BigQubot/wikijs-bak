= Preface

Taking BPI-M5 as example. Please prepare a Linux computer.

= Install Docker
```sh
curl -fsSL https://test.docker.com -o test-docker.sh
sudo sh test-docker.sh
```
After installation, the current user needs to be added to the Docker user group.

```sh
sudo groupadd docker
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```

= Configure Docker
First, obtain the image.

```sh
docker pull sinovoip/bpi-build-linux-4.4:ubuntu16.04
```
Create a file and run the image.

```sh
mkdir /home/bpi/image
docker run -d -p 2222:22 -v /home/bpi/image:/root sinovoip/bpi-build-linux-4.4:ubuntu16.04
```

The "/home/bpi/image:/root" above maps the physical machine's "/home/bpi/image" to the "/root" directory, with port 2222

After running, you can use "Docker Container ls" to view the dockers that have already been started.

Then connect to Docker via SSH with the password root.

Create a folder in Docker, which can also be seen on the physical machine.
