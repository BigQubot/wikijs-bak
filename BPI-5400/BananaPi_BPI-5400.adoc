= Description

The RT5400B series of modules are designed to extract power from a conventional
twisted pair Category 5 Ethernet cable, conforming to the IEEE 802.3af and IEEE 802.3at    Power-over-Ethernet(PoE) standard.

The RT5400B signature and control circuit provides the PoE compatibility signature and
power classification required by the Power Sourcing Equipment (PSE) before applying up
to 30W power to the port. 

The DC/DC converter operates over a wide input voltage range and provides a regulated
output. The DC/DC converter also has built-in short-circuit output protection.


== Features

* IEEE802.3at and IEEE802.3af compliant
* Maximum 30W output power
* Input voltage range 36V to 57V 
* Integral high efficiency DC/DC converter.
* Low output ripple and noise 
* High performance with low price
* Short-circuit protection 
* Transformer isolation ,1500V isolation (input to output) 
* Easy to use, with a minimum number of external components.

== Applications：
* IP Cameras
* Wireless access point
* Security and alarm systems
* VOIP telephone 
* Point of sale network terminal equipment

|Pin |	Name	|Description
|1	|VA1	|RX Input (1). This input pin is used in conjunction with VA2 and connects to the centre tap of the transformer connected to pins 1 & 2 of the RJ45 connector (RX) - it is not polarity sensitive.(5400B-S, POE Direct Input +. This pin connects to the positive (+) output of the POE input bridge rectifiers.)
|2	|VA2	|TX Input (2). This input pin is used in conjunction with VA1 and connects to the centre tap of the transformer connected to pins 3 & 6 of the RJ45 connector (TX) - it is not polarity sensitive.(5400B-S,POE Direct Input -. POE Direct Input -. This pin connects to the negative (-) output of the POE input bridge rectifiers..)
|3	|VB1|	Direct Input (1). This input pin is used in conjunction with VB2 and connects to pin 4 & 5 of the RJ45 connector - it is not polarity sensitive.
|4	|VB2	|Direct Input (2). This input pin is used in conjunction with VB1 and connects to pin 7 & 8 of the RJ45 connector - it is not polarity sensitive.
|5	|cap+	|Internal cap, need Match Dynamic load ,connecting A 22uf-100uf  63V
|6	|cap- |
|7	|-VDC	|DC Return. This pin is the return path for the +VDC output.
|8	|+VDC	|DC Output. This pin provides the regulated output from the DC/DC converter.
|9	|ADJ	|Output Adjust. The output voltage can be adjusted from is nominal value, by connecting an external resistor from this pin to either the +VDC pin or the -VDC pin.
|10	|-VDC|	DC Return. This pin is the return path for the +VDC output.

== Power Classification

The RT5400B classification is fixed at Class 4, this means that an IEEE802.3at Type 1 or an IEEE802.3af PSE will default to Class 0. However an IEEE802.3at PSE will recognise the Class 4 as a Type 2 PD.
