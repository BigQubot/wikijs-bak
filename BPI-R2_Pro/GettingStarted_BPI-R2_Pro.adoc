=== Install Image with SD card

. Download link:https://download.banana-pi.dev/d/ca025d76afd448aabc63/files/?p=%2FTools%2Fimage_download_tools%2FRKSDDiskTool_v1.7.zip[Rockchip SD Disk Tool].
. Insert card reader to Windows PC, 8GB sdcard size at least.

=== Boot Android from SDcard
Create a sdcard for android boot is almost the same as create a firmware upgrade sdcard, only one difference is select "SD Boot" mode instead of "Upgrade Firmware". This process lasts about 8 minutes, then safely remove the SDcard, insert it into the r2pro board and power on.

One thing to note is that make sure emmc is empty, you must erase it if flashed before. We recommend that use emmc for android boot because it is faster and more stable.

=== Build Android Source Code
. Get Android source code
+
```sh
 $ git clone https://github.com/BPI-SINOVOIP/BPI-Rockchip-Android11 --depth=1
```
or you can get the source code tar archive from link:https://pan.baidu.com/s/1c2vw-df4hh55VB3gSsM6Uw?pwd=8888[BaiduPan(pincode: 8888)] or link:https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_DkE_6dsTQ-HZoEDGdvFsYtf5_ARQXoh?usp=share_link[GoogleDrive]
. Build the Android Source code +
Please read the source code link:https://github.com/BPI-SINOVOIP/BPI-Rockchip-Android11/blob/master/README.md[README.md]

=== USB OTG Mode Switch
The top usb port is a usb 3.0 otg port, but without hw id pin, it only can be used as host or peripheral.The release image set host mode default, but you can change it in Settings

+
```sh
 $ adb push logo_kernel.bmp /sdcard/
 $ adb push logo.bmp /sdcard/
 $ adb root
 $ adb shell
```
create logo.img
+
```sh
 bananapi_r2pro:/ # cd /sdcard/
 bananapi_r2pro:/sdcard # cat logo.bmp > logo.img && truncate -s %512 
logo.img && cat logo_kernel.bmp >> logo.img
```
flash logo.img to logo partition
+
```sh
 bananapi_r2pro:/sdcard # dd if=logo.img  of=/dev/block/by-name/logo
 24301+1 records in
 24301+1 records out
 12442166 bytes (12 M) copied, 1.104449 s, 11 M/s
```
reboot android
+
