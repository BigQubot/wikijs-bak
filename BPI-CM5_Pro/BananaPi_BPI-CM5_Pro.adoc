TIP: 1 Designed as a board-to-board connector. +
2 Due to the RK3576 chip's PIN limitations, it supports only 1 HDMI and 1 DSI, whereas the Raspberry Pi CM4 supports up to 2 HDMI and 2 DSI. +
3 BPI-CM5 has an additional PCIe and USB3 compared to the Raspberry Pi CM4.


You can use the Raspberry Pi CM4 baseboard.
