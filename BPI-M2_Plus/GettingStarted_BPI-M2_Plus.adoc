=== Install Image to SD card

**Windows PC**

Install Image with Balena Etcher. +
link:https://balena.io/etcher[Balena Etcher] is an opensource GUI flash tool by Balena, Flash OS images to SDcard or USB drive.

. Click on "**Flash from file**" to select image. 
. Click on "**Select target**" to select USB device. 
. Click on "**Flash!**" Start burning.

image::/picture/etcher.jpg[etcher.jpg]

**Linux PC**

**There are two methods for you to choose from.**

. Install Image with dd command on Linux, umount SDcard device /dev/sdX partition if mounted automatically. Actually bpi-copy is the same as this dd command.
+
```sh
 $ sudo apt-get install pv unzip
 $ sudo unzip -p xxx-bpi-m5-xxx.img.zip | pv | dd of=/dev/sdX bs=10M status=noxfer
```
. Install image with bpi-tools on Linux, plug SDcard to Linux PC and run
+
```sh
 $ sudo apt-get install pv unzip
 $ sudo bpi-copy xxx-bpi-m5-xxx.img.zip /dev/sdX
```

 
=== Install Image to eMMC

. Copy "xxx-sd-emmc-xxx.img.zip / xxx-sd-emmc-xxx.img" to your USB disk
. Plug your USB disk in M2P
. Execute(If it is automatically mounted, skip this step)
+
```sh
mont /dev/sda1 /mnt
```
. There are two methods to burn images to eMMC.
- Using bpi-copy for burning.
+
```sh
bpi-copy xxx-sd-emmc-xxx.img.zip / xxx-sd-emmc-xxx.img
```
- Using the dd command for burning.
+
```sh
sudo dd if=/mnt/sda1/xxx-sd-emmc-xxx.img of=/dev/mmcblk0
```

. Then power off M2P, take TF card out, power on M2P with EMMC

=== Update image
For example, update your image to support new emmc5.1
```sh
  * execute “bpi-tools”, to update your bpi tools;
  * execute “bpi-update -c bpi-m2p.conf”, to download new driver to update your image
  * execute “file *.tgz”, to check download files’ type is compressed data
  * execute “bpi-bootsel”, you will see the bootloader path, “/usr/lib/u-boot/bananapi/bpi-m2p/BPI_M2P_720P.img.gz”
  * execute “bpi-bootsel /usr/lib/u-boot/bananapi/bpi-m2p/BPI_M2P_720P.img.gz”, to update your bootloader
  * reboot
```

== Advanced Development
=== How to build uboot & kernel
**Install tools**

```sh
apt-get udpate
apt-get install gcc-arm-linux-gnueabihf u-boot-tools
apt-get install pv
curl -sL https://github.com/BPI-SINOVOIP/bpi-tools/raw/master/bpi-tools | sudo -E bash
```

**Clone code**

```sh
git clone: https://github.com/BPI-SINOVOIP/BPI-M2P-bsp.git
./build.sh
```
=== How to create an image
. Prepare a SD card which have installed system(Ubuntu/Raspbian/..)
. Boot your SD card with M2P, after M2P finish starting, copy your files and config your system, then poweroff M2P. [If you don't want to config your system, you can skip this step]
. Plug your SD card in PC(which is running Linux)
+
```sh
cd /media
ln -s <your account> pi
```
. Execute
+
```sh
bpi-migrate -c bpi-m2p.conf -c ubuntu-mate-from-sd.conf -d /dev/sdx
```
. Then you could get your own image now

=== GPIO Control
- To access a GPIO pin you first need to export it with
+
```sh
 echo XX > /sys/class/gpio/export
```
- with XX being the number of the desired pin. To obtain the correct number you have to calculate it from the pin name (like PH18) 
+
(position of letter in alphabet - 1) * 32 + pin number 
+
for PH18 this would be ( 8 - 1) * 32 + 18 = 224 + 18 = 242 (since 'h' is the 8th letter)
+
```sh  
echo "out/in" > /sys/class/gpio/gpio*NUMBER*/direction
 echo "0/1" > /sys/class/gpio/gpio*NUMBER*/value
```

=== OTG
. On M2P console:
+
Execute 
+
```sh
./adbd.sh
ps -ax | grep adbd
```
see if adbd is set up

. On PC terminal:

- If adbd was succeed to set up, insert OTG-USB interface to M2P and PC(with Ubuntu system)

- Execute
+
```sh
adb devices
```
see if PC has recognised M2P OTG.
+
- If yes, we could execute
+
```sh
adb shell
```
connect M2P by adb now.

=== GMAC
Use iperf3 to test gmac

image::/picture/m2p_gmac.png[m2p_gmac.png]

=== Bluetooth
- Use bluetoothctl tool to operate BT
- Execute "**bluetoothctl**"
- If you don't know how to use bluetoothctl, type "**help**", you will see more commands
- Execute these commands:

image::/picture/m2p_bt_bluetoothctl.png[m2p_bt_bluetoothctl.png]

image::/picture/m2p_bt.png[m2p_bt.png]

=== WiFi
Driver code: https://github.com/BPI-SINOVOIP/BPI_WiFi_Firmware

**You have two ways to setup WiFi Client**

. Use commands to setup WiFi client
+
```sh
ip link set wlan0 up
iw dev wlan0 scan | grep SSID
vim /etc/wpasupplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf
```
+
```sh
 network={    
 ssid="ssid"    
 psk="password"    
 priority=1 
 }
```
+
```sh
wpa_supplicant -iwlan0 -c /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf
dhclient wlan0
```
. Use UI interface to setup WiFi Client

=== Change Logo

. Download M2P bsp code
+
```sh
git clone https://github.com/BPI-SINOVOIP/BPI-M2P-bsp
cd BPI-M2P-bsp
```
. Change to your boot logo
+
Prepare a ".bmp" picture, here I rotate 180°, as follows :
+
image::/picture/m2p_cl_1.png[m2p_cl_1.png]

- Change your picture name as "**bootlogo.bmp**"
- put your picture to "sunxi-pack/chips/sun8iw7p1/configs/BPI-M2P-xxxP/"
Here I replaced “bootlogo.bmp” which is under “sunxi-pack/chips/sun8iw7p1/configs/BPI-M2P-720P/” as an example:
+
image::/picture/m2p_cl_2.png[m2p_cl_2.png]

. Build your code
+
```sh
./build.sh BPI-M2P-720P
```
choose 1
+
image::/picture/m2p_cl_3.png[m2p_cl_3.png]
+
After you built the project, you will see “**SD**” directory
+
image::/picture/m2p_cl_4.png[m2p_cl_4.png]

. Install a raspbian image on your SD card

. Plug your SD card into your Ubuntu PC
+
check your SD card was recognised as /dev/sdxx, as you can see, mine sd card was recognised as /dev/sde
+
image::/picture/m2p_cl_5.png[m2p_cl_5.png]

. Then
+
```sh
cd SD/bpi-m2p/100MB
```

. Execute 
+
```sh
bpi-bootsel BPI-M2P-720P.img.gz /dev/sde
```
+
image::/picture/m2p_cl_6.png[m2p_cl_6.png]

=== Clear boot
