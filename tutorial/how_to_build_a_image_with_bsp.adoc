= Introduction

== Step One: Download and compile BSP code
Here I use BPI-M4 as an example:

. Download bsp code,execute
+
```sh
git clone https://github.com/BPI-SINOVOIP/BPI-M4-bsp.git
```

. Build the bsp,execute
+
```sh
./build.sh
```
then choose "**1**".

+
image::/picture/build_image_1.png[build_image_1.png]

. After built bsp code, the boot and kernel files will be generated in "**SD/bpi-m4**".
+
image::/picture/build_image_2.png[build_image_2.png]

== Step Two: Install an image on SD card
. You could install an image by following here: Install Linux & Android images on Banana pi SBC

. Here I install an image under a ubuntu os
+
```sh
bpi-copy 2019-07-23-ubuntu-18.04-mate-desktop-preview-bpi-w2-m4-sd-emmc.img.zip /dev/sde
```
+
image::/picture/build_image_3.png[build_image_3.png]

== Step Three: Make an image
. Our bsp could not build an image directly, so we need to make an image from sd card which has been installed an image.

. Plug sd card which we just installed an image into a ubuntu PC, then the PC will recognize "**BPI-BOOT**" and "**BPI-ROOT**".

. Now we do some preparations before make an image:
+
```sh
cd /media
ln -s <your account> pi
mkdir <directory>
cp <BPI-M4-Project>/SD/bpi-m4/*.tgz <BPI-M4-Project>/SD/bpi-m4/100MB/* image
```

. As you can see, I linked an account called "**pi**" under "**/media**", created an folder and copied all the bsp files into it.

. Now we could use command
+
```sh
bpi-migrate -c bpi-w2-m4.conf -c ubuntu-18.04-mate-from-sd.conf
```
+
image::/picture/build_image_4.png[build_image_4.png]

. This command will copy the os from the sd card, and replace new kernel and uboot you just built in the new image.
