== Application scenarios

In addition to conventional computing applications, the BPI-3A6000 can also be pre-installed with the following industrial control applications, including but not limited to:

* 300+ Industry general/industry specific protocol library
* Video access transmission/control/recording/linkage function
* Computational programming capabilities
* Industrial firewall function
* Soft PLC programming function
* C/S architecture SCADA system functions
* B/S architecture SCADA system functions

== Product feature
* Mini size 
** The volume of the whole machine is less than 1L, which is 40 times smaller than the desktop
** Small size, easy to carry, easy to organize, one hand
** Can support wall hanging, can be hung behind the monitor/TV series, save desktop space
* High performance
** Using the fourth generation of Loongson 3A6000 CPU+7A2000 bridge
** Supports two DDR4 SODIMM slots
** Supports memory rates up to 3200Mbps
** Supports multiple CPU cores, up to 4 physical cores and 8 logical cores
* High reliability
** Advanced memory fault-tolerant ECC function (currently not supported by existing BIOS)
** The use of all copper fin cooling architecture, so that the CPU performance is fully developed, full load performance is still reliable
** Support intelligent speed adjustment function, the fan speed dynamically adjusts with the system temperature, effectively reducing the system noise and power consumption
* Interface rich
** Multiple interface types, can meet the needs of multiple scenarios at the same time
** Dual display interface to achieve dual 1080P output at the same time, create a multi-screen working environment, improve efficiency and entertainment experience
** NVMe and SATA interface dual hard disk design, easy to expand, increase storage space
