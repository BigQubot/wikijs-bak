We compiled this Getting Started Guide to help you get started with this
BPI-Leaf-S3 development board quickly.

== First Thing

Use a USB-C cable with power and data functions to connect the
BPI-Leaf-S3 development board to your computer.

When using it for the first time, its ws2812 LED will flash green once.

BPI-Leaf-S3 has been programmed with MicroPython 1.19.1 firmware. It is
recommended for beginners to use MicroPython to develop and learn.

== Use MicroPython to get started quickly

. See link:./MicroPython/environment.md[Install and configure the
environment], install Python 3, mpremote tool, mpbridge tool, VScode
IDE.
. See link:./MicroPython/VScode_mpbridge.md[How to use VScode + mpbridge
tool] to learn how to connect to the development board, copy, modify,
and delete files on the development board.
. See link:./MicroPython/REPL_use_case.md[REPL Use Case] to quickly
understand the common shortcut keys of MicroPython REPL and the method
of viewing modules.

. After the above three steps, you can start developing.

. For learning Python and MicroPython, we recommend getting started with
Python in the link:https://docs.python.org/3.10/tutorial/index.html[Python
Tutorial]. 
+
Also,try to learn about link:./MicroPython/What_is_MicroPython[What is MicroPython?]

. Apply what you have learned in Python, and look at the
link:https://docs.micropython.org/en/latest/index.html[MicroPython
documentation], you can quickly refer to MicroPythonâ€™s special library,
ESP32 port special library for our development.

. Learn some of the differences between the two on the page
link:https://docs.micropython.org/en/latest/genrst/index.html#[Differences
between MicroPython and CPython].

. In the next section of this page, you can find some MicroPython example
that may help you.
