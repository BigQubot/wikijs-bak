== Key Features
- MediaTek MT7623N, Quad-core ARM Cortex-A7
- Mali 450 MP4 GPU
- 2G DDR3 SDRAM
- 1x Mini PCIE interface

= Hardware
== BPI-R2 SATA interface
BPI-R2 support 2 sata interface and onboard power port.



You can use sata line connect your hardisk on BPI-R2.

Test a SAMSUNG SSD DISK, the Read/Write performance are below:

Read from disk: 230MB/s 
```sh
dd if=/dev/sda of=/dev/zero bs=1M count=10240\
```

Write to disk: 192MB/s 
```sh
dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sda bs=1M count=1024 oflag=direct\
```

WARNING: Note: if you use 3.5 big hardisk ,you may need power with outside power. on board power maybe can not support enough current
= Development
Let's get start to develop on BPI-R2, see amazing things happen.

== Prepare to develop
* Prepare 16G/above TF card, USB-Serial interface, Ubuntu System
* Using your USB-Serial (3.3V,Baud: 115200)  Connect debug console on R2
* Default IP address for LAN port: 192.168.1.1
* User name/password: pi/bananapi ,root/bananapi. +
Or the user is root without a password.

== Load your first image on R2
. You could download latest image from our forum
+
Here is the example image link: http://forum.banana-pi.org/t/bpi-r2-new-image-release-ubuntu-16-04-v1-3-2018-3-30/5293

+
```sh
apt-get install pv
curl -sL https://github.com/BPI-SINOVOIP/bpi-tools/raw/master/bpi-tools | sudo -E bash
```
 
. After you download the image, insert your TF card into your Ubuntu
+
```sh
bpi-copy xxx.img /dev/sdx
```
. After step 3, then you can insert your TF card into R2, and press power button for around 10s to setup R2

== Update Your Ubuntu On SD Card
. Clone Bsp project from Github
 * Execute "git clone git@github.com:BPI-SINOVOIP/BPI-R2-bsp.git" 
 
. Execute "./build.sh", to build your own uboot and kernel.
R2 build sh.png
 
. After finish built, Execute "cd SD", plug your Ubuntu TFcard in PC. 
 
. Execute "bpi-update -c bpi-r2.conf -d /dev/sdX", to update the compiled kernel to your TFcard.

== Ubuntu On Emmc
If you want to install Ubuntu on EMMC, follow these stepsï¼š

* Burn an image to sd card, and set up R64 with sd card.
* Copy the image which name contains "xxx-emmc-xxx" to U disk.
* mount U disk to R64, then use bpi-copy to burn image to Emmc. 
```sh
   bpi-copy  <XXX.img.zip> 
```
* XXX.img.zip is ubuntu image we can get it from http://www.banana-pi.org/r2-download.html 
 * power off
