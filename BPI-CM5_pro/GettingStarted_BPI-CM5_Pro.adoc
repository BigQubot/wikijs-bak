= Interface Usage

If you are using the CM5 Kit for the first time, please familiarize yourself with the hardware interfaces of each product, which will help you better understand the following content.

== Debugging Serial Port

Connect the USB to TTL serial cable as shown below:

image::/bpi-cm5_pro/bpi-cm5_pro_debug_port.png[bpi-cm5_pro_debug_port.png]

[options="header",cols="1,1,1"]
|====
|CM5-IO	|Connect	|Serial Module
|GND (pin 6)|	--->	|GND
|TX (pin 8)|	--->|	RX
|RX (pin 10)	|--->	|TX
|====

== Ethernet Port

1,First, insert one end of the Ethernet cable into the CM5 Kit's Ethernet port, and connect the other end to the router, ensuring that the network is functioning properly.

2,After the system starts, an IP address will be automatically assigned to the Ethernet card via DHCP, with no additional configuration needed.

3,To view the IP address in the Linux system on the CM5 Kit, use the following command:

```sh
root@armsom-cm5:/# ip a
1: lo: <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN group default qlen 1000
    link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00
    inet 127.0.0.1/8 scope host lo
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
    inet6 ::1/128 scope host noprefixroute
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
2: end0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc mq state UP group default qlen 1000
    link/ether c6:9c:b0:7e:2b:1f brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff permaddr aa:a6:84:1b:0d:21
    inet 192.168.10.78/24 brd 192.168.10.255 scope global dynamic noprefixroute enP4p65s0
       valid_lft 86221sec preferred_lft 86221sec
    inet6 fe80::5bb0:d96f:926d:b334/64 scope link noprefixroute
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
3: wlan0: <NO-CARRIER,BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP> mtu 1500 qdisc mq state DOWN group default qlen 1000
    link/ether cc:64:1a:33:b5:40 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
4: wlan1: <NO-CARRIER,BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP> mtu 1500 qdisc mq state DOWN group default qlen 1000
    link/ether ce:64:1a:33:b5:40 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
    
```

After the BPI-CM5 Pro Kit starts up, there are three ways to check the IP address:

* Connect an HDMI monitor, log into the system, and use the terminal to enter the ip a command to check the IP address.
* Connect a [debug serial port](#Debugging Serial Port) and use the terminal to enter the ip a command to check the IP address.
* If you do not have a debug serial port or an HDMI monitor, you can also check the IP address of the CM5 Kit's Ethernet port through the router's management interface. However, sometimes the IP address may not be visible on the router. If the IP address is not visible, troubleshoot as follows:
** First, check if the Linux system has started normally. If the green light on the CM5 Kit is steady, it has generally started correctly.
** Check if the Ethernet cable is securely connected, or try a different cable.
** Try using a different router, as issues have been encountered where routers cannot properly assign IP addresses or the assigned IP address does not show up on the router.
** If no other router is available, you will need to connect an HDMI monitor or use a debug serial port to check the IP address.

TIP: Note that DHCP automatic IP assignment on the CM5 Kit does not require any configuration.

4,Use the ping tool to check network connectivity.

** The command to test network connectivity is shown below. You can interrupt the ping command by pressing Ctrl+C.

```sh

 * Set the GPIO pin to output mode. The third parameter requires the wPi number corresponding to the pin.
 
```sh
 root@armsom-sige7:~/wiring-armbian# gpio mode 2 out
```

* Set the GPIO pin to output a low level. After setting, you can measure the voltage on the pin with a multimeter; if it reads 0V, the low level is set successfully.

```sh
root@armsom-sige7:~/wiring-armbian# gpio write 2 0
```

* Set the GPIO pin to output a high level. After setting, you can measure the voltage on the pin with a multimeter; if it reads 3.3V, the high level is set successfully.

```sh
root@armsom-sige7:~/wiring-armbian# gpio write 2 1
```

* The setup method for other pins is similar; just change the wPi number to the corresponding pin's number.

== HDMI

The BPI-CM5 Pro Kit supports HDMI up to 4Kp120.

* Use an HDMI cable to connect the CM5 Kit to an HDMI display.
* After booting the Linux system, if the HDMI display has an image output, it indicates that the HDMI interface is working normally.

TIP: Note: Many laptops have an HDMI port, but it usually only supports output, not HDMI input. This means it cannot display the HDMI output from other devices on the laptop screen. If you plan to connect the development board's HDMI to a laptop's HDMI port, please first confirm that your laptop supports HDMI input. If HDMI does not display anything, please check if the system you are using has a desktop version, as the server version will only display a terminal.

HDMI to VGA Display Test

1,You will need the following accessories:

* HDMI to VGA adapter
* A VGA cable and a monitor that supports VGA input

2,The HDMI to VGA display test is shown below:

image::/bpi-cm5_pro/banana_pi_bpi-cm5_pro_hdmi_setting.jpg[banana_pi_bpi-cm5_pro_hdmi_setting.jpg]

TIP: When using HDMI to VGA display, there is no need to configure anything on the CM5 Kit or Linux system. As long as the HDMI interface on the development board displays correctly, it should work. If you encounter issues, please check the HDMI to VGA adapter, VGA cable, and monitor.

== USB
=== USB Mouse or Keyboard Connection Test

* Insert a USB keyboard into the CM5 Kit's USB port.
* Connect the CM5 Kit to an HDMI display.
* If the mouse or keyboard can operate the system normally, it indicates that the USB port is working correctly (the mouse can only be used in a desktop version of the system).

=== USB Storage Device Connection Test

* Insert a USB flash drive or USB external hard drive into the CM5 Kit's USB port.
* Run the following command. If you see an output for sdX, it indicates that the USB drive is recognized successfully:
```sh
root@armsom-cm5:/# cat /proc/partitions | grep "sd*"
major minor  #blocks  name
   8        0  122880000 sda
```

* Use the mount command to mount the USB drive to /mnt/, and then you can view the files on the USB drive:
```sh
root@armsom-cm5:/# sudo mount /dev/sda1 /test/
```
* After mounting, use the df -h command to check the USB drive’s capacity and mount point:
```sh
root@armsom-cm5:/test# df -h | grep "sd"
/dev/sda        4.7G  4.7G     0  100% /test
```

=== USB Camera

* Prepare a USB camera that supports the UVC protocol, then insert the USB camera into the CM5 Kit's USB port.

* Use the v4l2-ctl command to see the device node information for the USB camera, which will be /dev/video0:
```sh
root@armsom-cm5:/# v4l2-ctl --list-devices
Logitech HD Webcam C93 (usb-xhci-hcd.5.auto-1):
        /dev/video40
        /dev/video41
        /dev/media4
```
* On a desktop system, you can use Cheese/V4L2 Test Bench to directly open the USB camera:
