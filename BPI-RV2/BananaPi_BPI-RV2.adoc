Banana Pi BPI-RV2 open source gateway is a device based on Siflower SF21H8898 SoC, 1 × 2.5G WAN network interface, 5 Gigabit LAN network interface, onboard 512MB DDR3 memory, 128 MiB NAND, 16 MiB NOR, M.2 interface, MINI PCIE and USB 2.0 interface, etc.

Banana Pi BPI-RV2 open source gateway is a collaboration between Siflower and Banana Pi open source community (Banana Pi)

== SF2H8898 chip Brief

SF21H8898 is a high performance industrial-grade SOC gateway chip developed by Siflower Communications. It adopts advanced TSMC 12nm FFC process and integrates four cores inside
64-bit RISC-V processor and dedicated network processing accelerator (NPU) (supports L2/L3 hardware processing, IPv4/IPv6 dual stack, 20Gbps switching capacity, full byte wire-speed forwarding), network-side support for QSGMII, SGMII/HSGMII and RGMII interfaces. IEEE 1588 PTP functionality is supported for time synchronization. It supports external DDR3/DDR3L/DDR4 SDRAM and NAND/NOR SPI Flash. The high-speed interface is USB2.0, PCIE2.0, and the low-speed interface is SPI, UART, I2C, PWM, etc. It can be used as enterprise gateway and industrial control gateway.
