=== How to buld M3 Bsp code
. Prepare a PC which runs ubuntu
. Install Docker-ce on your PC，https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/#install-docker-ce (Install Docker Environment)
. After install Docker, pull docker image,execute
+
```sh
docker pull sinovoip/bpi-build:ubuntu12.04
```
. Then you pulled image,create a port to login docker image, execute
+
```sh
docker run --privileged -d -p 2222:22 -v /media:/media sinovoip/bpi-build:ubuntu12.04
```
. login in docker image
+
```sh
ssh -p 2222 root@127.0.0.1 #default passwd is root
```
. Git clone M3 bsp code,execute 
+
```sh
git clone https://github.com/BPI-SINOVOIP/BPI-M3-bsp.git
```
. Build M3 bsp code,execute
+
```sh
./build.sh
```
. After built, open a new terminal, you could copy the compile files out of docker image by executing
+
```sh
docker cp <your container id>:<your project path> <your pc path>
```

=== Update your image
For example, update your image to support new emmc5.1

```sh
bpi-tools
bpi-update -c bpi-m3.conf
file *.tgz
bpi-bootsel
bpi-bootsel /usr/lib/u-boot/bananapi/bpi-m3/BPI_M3_720P.img.gz
reboot
```

=== Make your own image

- Make one raspbian image

- Prepare a SD card which have installed Raspbian system

- Boot your SD card with M3, after M3 finish starting, copy your files and config your Raspbian, then poweroff M3

- Plug your SD card in Linux PC
+
```sh
cd /media
ln -s <your account> pi
```

- Execute 
+
```sh
bpi-migrate -c bpi-m3.conf -c raspbian-jessie-from-sd.conf -d /dev/sdx
```

- Then you could get your own image now

== Advanced Development
=== Install Docker
You could try armbian to install docker, here is the image: https://dl.armbian.com/bananapim3/Debian_stretch_dev.7z (Here Thanks for the armbian community)

Download this image to your ubuntu PC (I am using ubuntu PC), then decompress it
```sh
7z x Debian_stretch_xxx.img
bpi-copy Debian_stretch_xxx.img /dev/sd< drive letter >
``` 
Username: root, password: 1234

Here are steps to install docker:
```sh
vim /etc/apt/sources.list
add this source：“deb http://http.debian.net/debian jessie-backports main”
apt-get update
apt-get install docker.io
```
To have a test, if docker has installed in your image.
```sh
sudo docker run --rm hello-world
```

=== SATA
. Mount SATA on M3
+
```sh
fdisk -l
mount /dev/sdx /mnt/xxx
```
+
image::/picture/m3_sata.png[m3_sata.png]

. If you meet some errors when you mount SATA, try these following commands:
+
```sh
fdisk /dev/sdx
```
to create new partition , set your partition numbers and size, after created partitions, input "wq" to save and quit.
+
```sh
mkfs.ext2 /dev/sdx
mount /dev/sdx /mnt/xxx
```
. After you success to insert SATA, we could input following commands to test SATA interface:

- Test read speed
+
```SH
time dd if=/dev/xxx of=/dev/null bs=1M count=1000
```
- Test write speed
+
```sh
time dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdx bs=1M count=1000
```
+
image::/picture/sata_test.png[sata_test.png]

=== OTG
. On M3 console:
+
Execute
+
```sh
./adbd.sh
ps -ax | grep adbd
```
to see if adbd is set up
+
image::/picture/m2p_adbd.png[m2p_adbd.png]

. On PC terminal:

- If adbd was succeed to set up, insert OTG-USB interface to M3 and PC(with Ubuntu system)
- Execute
+
```sh
adb devices
```
to see if PC has recognised M3 OTG
- If yes, we could execute
+
```sh
adb shell
```
to connect M3 by adb now
+
image::/picture/m2p_adbd_shell.png[m2p_adbd_shell.png]

=== LCD 5" & LCD 7"
- Execute
+
```sh
bpi-bootsel
```
you'll see a list of boot files.Find "**BPI_M3_LCD7.img.gz**"

- Then execute
+
```sh
bpi-bootsel /usr/lib/u-boot/bananapi/bpi-M3/BPI_M3_LCD7.img.gz
```
+
image::/picture/m3_bootsel_lcd7.png[m3_bootsel_lcd7.png]

=== GMAC
Use iperf3 to test gmac

. On PC Terminal:
+
```sh
iperf3 -s
```

. On M3 console:

- TCP test
+
```sh
iperf3 -c serverIP
```
- UDP test
+
```sh
iperf3 -u -c serverIP
```

image::/picture/m3_gmac_test.png[m3_gmac_test.png]

=== Bluetooth
Use bluetoothctl tool to operate BT

- Execute
+
```sh
bluetoothctl
```
If you don't know how to use bluetoothctl, type "help", you will see more commands
- Execute these commands:
+

priority=1 
}
```
+
```sh
