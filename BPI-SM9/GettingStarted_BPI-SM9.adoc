= Development

== Prepare

* 12V/3A power adapter(The voltage range is between 11 and 13 volts. Using a 12V power adapter is the most suitable option.)

* Using your USB-Serial cable(3.3V TTL,Baud=115200) Connect to debug console on BPI-SM9

* One TF card(If you want to use the FT card for system startup)

* One Type-C cable (for upgrade programming)

=== TTL Debugport
