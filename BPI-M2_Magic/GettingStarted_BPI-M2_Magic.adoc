NOTE: Note: three pin header uart0 beside usb port is not debug uart for bpi release images because SDcard and uart0 are multiplex pin and default bpi images support both SD and eMMC. If you want bootup with emmc only and enable uart0 as debug port without SDcard support, please refer to enable link:https://wiki.banana-pi.org/Getting_Started_with_M2M#Enable_uart0_for_emmc_only_image_debug[uart0 debug for emmc only image] section.
