=== SSH debugging

Connect the PC's internet cable to a LAN port (one of the LAN ports circled in the image below).



Or connect to a WiFi on the R4 router.(Please see link:/en/BPI-R4/BananaPi_BPI-R4_FAQ[here] for WiFi usage)


After obtaining the IP, use the ssh tool on the PC to enter the corresponding IP for connection debugging.

Open link:https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/download.html[MobaXterm], then click on Session in the upper left corner and select SSH.

image::/picture/log_export-1.jpg[log_export-1.jpg]

In Remote host, fill in the IP address of the device you want to connect to, check Specify username and fill in the login username, and fill in the port number.

(The default IP address is 192.168.1.1. You can also verify this by checking the IP address you obtained. If the IP address you obtained is 192.168.11.213, then the IP address of R4 is 192.168.11.1.)

(The default login username is root and the default port is 22.)



== No serial port output

If there is no output from the serial port, first debug the system using SSH as described in link:/en/BPI-R4/BananaPi_BPI-R4_FAQ#_ssh_debugging[R4 Debugging Methods - SSH] to see if the system boots normally. (If you can't obtain an IP address or SSH connection fails, see link:/en/BPI-R4/BananaPi_BPI-R4_FAQ#_the_system_cannot_start_or_fails_to_start[The system cannot start or fails to start].)

. Check that the computer has a working serial cable.
+
Check that the PC has the corresponding serial port driver.

. Alternatively, replace the serial cable to determine if the hardware is faulty.

. Check whether the TTL line is connected correctly and whether the baud rate is selected correctly.

. Re-plug the TTL cable to check if it is caused by improper connection.

. If you have checked the above steps and confirmed that the problem lies with the motherboard hardware, please contact us and provide the following information: 
- Describe how you caused this phenomenon.
- Photo of the board powered on (the TTL line and DIP switch should be clearly visible), and photos of the MobaXterm software. You can also take a video.

== Determine the size of the DDR memory in R4

NOTE: Before verification, please ensure that the image is used correctly. You can download the correct image from the official website to perform the verification. link:/en/BPI-R4/BananaPi_BPI-R4#_openwrt[image Link]

=== SD card

If you have verified that the DIP switches are correctly positioned, proceed to the following steps.

. After powering on the board, check if the PWR light in the upper right corner of the board is on. (If not, proceed to step 5.)

. Reseat and remove the SD card to check for poor contact.

. If the boot failure is due to a malfunction, format the SD card and re-burn the image file. (Use link:/en/BPI-R4/BananaPi_BPI-R4#_openwrt_mtk_mp4_1_wifi_sdk_wifi_driver_for_be14000_wifi_card[MP4.1] for the image file.For burning instructions, see link:/en/BPI-R4/GettingStarted_BPI-R4#_how_to_burn_image_to_sd_card[Getting Started].)
. Replace the SD card and re-burn the image file to verify again.

. Once the issue is confirmed, please contact us and provide the following information:

- Describe the issue you are experiencing and how it occurred.

- Photo of the board powered on (the TTL lines and DIP switches must be clearly visible).

- Provide the serial port log file.

NOTE: After the burning process, there is a possibility of encountering jffs2 errors upon startup.

== OpenWRT mainline image txpower low

Customers who purchased our BPI-R4+BE14 and are using the OpenWRT mainline image have found that their 2.4G and 5G WiFi transmit power is only 6dBm and 7dBm respectively. Here is the solution:

1. Prepare a Linux host.

2. Download the source code for the corresponding mainline branch.

3. Place the link:https://github.com/immortalwrt/immortalwrt/blob/master/package/kernel/mt76/patches/100-wifi-mt76-mt7996-Use-tx_power-from-default-fw-if-EEP.patch[patch] file in the `**package/kernel/mt76/patches/**` directory.

4. Execute the following command:
+
```
make clean
make
```
5. Burn the compiled image to SD/NAND/eMMC and boot.

6. Update and install the web page.
+
```
opkg update
opkg install luci

/etc/init.d/uhttpd enable
/etc/init.d/uhttpd start
```
7. Go to the web page and turn on WiFi. Then use the `iw dev` command to see that the WiFi speed is now 20dBm.
