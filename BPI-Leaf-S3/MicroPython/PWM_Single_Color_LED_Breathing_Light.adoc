== External Hardware Requirements

A LED light that can work on 3.3v.

== connection method

The GPIO13 pin is used in the routine, and the positive pole of the LED light is connected to the GPIO13 pin, and the negative pole is connected to GND.

== Code

```py
from machine import Pin, PWM
import time

PWM_LED = PWM(Pin(13))
PWM_LED.freq(1000)
PWM_LED. duty(0)

while True:
     for i in range(0,1024,1):
        PWM_LED. duty(i)
        time. sleep_ms(2)
     for i in range(1022,0,-1):
        PWM_LED. duty(i)
        time. sleep_ms(1)
    
```
