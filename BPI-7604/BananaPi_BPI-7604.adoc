= Description

BPI-7604 series of modules are designed to extract power from a conventional twisted pair Category 5 Ethernet cable, conforming to the IEEE 802.3af Power-over-Ethernet(PoE) standard. BPI-7604 signature and control circuit provides the PoE compatibility signature and power classification required by the Power Sourcing Equipment (PSE) before applying up to 15W power to the port. BPI-7604 provides a Class 0 signature. BPI-7604 DC/DC converter operates over a wide input voltage range and provides a regulated output. The DC/DC converter also has built-in short-circuit output protection.
