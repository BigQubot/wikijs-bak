= Banana Pi BPI-CM2 Introduction

Banana Pi BPI-CM2 is a computer module with Rockchip RK3568 Quad-core ARM Cortex-A55 CPU, Mali-G52 1-Core-2EE GPU,2GB LPDDR4/LPDDR4x ,16G eMMC flash (Max 128G),Designed with Board to Board connectors for enhanced stability same as Raspberry Pi CM4 , which means that it should work with carrier boards designed for the Raspberry Pi CM4.

Rockchip RK3568 provides a wealth of interface resources. In addition to the board-to-board connectors compatible with the Raspberry PI, other interfaces are also drawn from the board-to-board interface, so that you can design your own base board and use of the rich interface resources of the RK3568.

== Rockchip RK3568

RK3568 has built-in MICRO-research NPU of Rockchip, 0.8Tops computing power and integrated high performance AI accelerator RKNN NPU. Rockchip also provides developers with an easy-to-use model transformation tool, RKNN-Toolkit, which supports one-click transformation of Caffe/TensorFlow/TF-Lite/ONNX/PyTorch/Keras/Darknet mainstream architecture models.
