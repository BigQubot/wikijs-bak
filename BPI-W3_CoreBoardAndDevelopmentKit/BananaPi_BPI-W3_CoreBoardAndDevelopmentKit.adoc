NOTE: It is not recommended to use the LM7 for 8K display,because the HDMI output 8K places very high layout routing requirements that are basically unachievable with a core board + base board design approach.

Here are some tips for your design reference:

* A one-piece board design must be adopted.Please pay attention that there is no layer change across the entire HDMI signal path.

* Strictly follow the hardware reference design guidelines for impedance control, trace length matching, etc.

* The HDMI connector is required to support HDMI 2.1 protocol ,8K compatible.
