You can also judge by light. When the light changes from constant on to off, it indicates that the combustion is complete.
.  After the burning is completed, the power will be cut off, and the SD card will be removed. Power on again to start from EMMC.

=== How to buld M3 Bsp code
. Prepare a PC which runs ubuntu

== Linux
=== Prepare

. Prepare 8G/above TF card, USB-Serial interface
. Using your USB-Serial Connect debug console on M2P
. Login user/password: pi/bananapi or root/bananapi.

=== Install Image to SD card

**Windows PC**

Install Image with Balena Etcher. +
link:https://balena.io/etcher[Balena Etcher] is an opensource GUI flash tool by Balena, Flash OS images to SDcard or USB drive.

. Click on "**Flash from file**" to select image. 
. Click on "**Select target**" to select USB device. 
. Click on "**Flash!**" Start burning.

image::/picture/etcher.jpg[etcher.jpg]

**Linux PC**

**There are two methods for you to choose from.**

. Install Image with dd command on Linux, umount SDcard device /dev/sdX partition if mounted automatically. Actually bpi-copy is the same as this dd command.
+
```sh
 $ sudo apt-get install pv unzip
 $ sudo unzip -p xxx-bpi-m3-xxx.img.zip | pv | dd of=/dev/sdX bs=10M status=noxfer
```
. Install image with bpi-tools on Linux, plug SDcard to Linux PC and run
+
```sh
 $ sudo apt-get install pv unzip
 $ sudo bpi-copy xxx-bpi-m3-xxx.img.zip /dev/sdX
```

 
=== Install Image to eMMC

. Copy "xxx-sd-emmc-xxx.img.zip / xxx-sd-emmc-xxx.img" to your USB disk
. Plug your USB disk in M3
. Execute(If it is automatically mounted, skip this step)
+
```sh
mont /dev/sda1 /mnt
```
. There are two methods to burn images to eMMC.
- Using bpi-copy for burning.
+
```sh
bpi-copy xxx-sd-emmc-xxx.img.zip / xxx-sd-emmc-xxx.img
```
- Using the dd command for burning.
+
```sh
sudo dd if=/mnt/sda1/xxx-sd-emmc-xxx.img of=/dev/mmcblk0
```

. Then power off M3, take TF card out, power on M3 with EMMC


=== Update your image
For example, update your image to support new emmc5.1

```sh
bpi-tools
bpi-update -c bpi-m3.conf
file *.tgz
bpi-bootsel
bpi-bootsel /usr/lib/u-boot/bananapi/bpi-m3/BPI_M3_720P.img.gz
reboot
```

=== Make your own image

- Make one raspbian image

- Prepare a SD card which have installed Raspbian system

- Boot your SD card with M3, after M3 finish starting, copy your files and config your Raspbian, then poweroff M3

- Plug your SD card in Linux PC
+
```sh
cd /media
ln -s <your account> pi
```

- Execute 
+
```sh
bpi-migrate -c bpi-m3.conf -c raspbian-jessie-from-sd.conf -d /dev/sdx
```

- Then you could get your own image now

== Advanced Development
=== Install Docker
You could try armbian to install docker, here is the image: https://dl.armbian.com/bananapim3/Debian_stretch_dev.7z (Here Thanks for the armbian community)

Download this image to your ubuntu PC (I am using ubuntu PC), then decompress it
```sh
7z x Debian_stretch_xxx.img
bpi-copy Debian_stretch_xxx.img /dev/sd< drive letter >
``` 
Username: root, password: 1234

Here are steps to install docker:
```sh
vim /etc/apt/sources.list
add this source：“deb http://http.debian.net/debian jessie-backports main”
apt-get update
apt-get install docker.io
```
To have a test, if docker has installed in your image.
```sh
sudo docker run --rm hello-world
```

=== SATA
. Mount SATA on M3
+
```sh
fdisk -l
mount /dev/sdx /mnt/xxx
```
+
image::/picture/m3_sata.png[m3_sata.png]

. If you meet some errors when you mount SATA, try these following commands:
+
```sh
fdisk /dev/sdx
```
to create new partition , set your partition numbers and size, after created partitions, input "wq" to save and quit.
+
```sh
mkfs.ext2 /dev/sdx
mount /dev/sdx /mnt/xxx
```
. After you success to insert SATA, we could input following commands to test SATA interface:

- Test read speed
+
```SH
time dd if=/dev/xxx of=/dev/null bs=1M count=1000
```
- Test write speed
+
```sh
time dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdx bs=1M count=1000
```
+
image::/picture/sata_test.png[sata_test.png]

=== OTG
. On M3 console:
+
Execute
+
```sh
./adbd.sh
ps -ax | grep adbd
```
to see if adbd is set up
+
image::/picture/m2p_adbd.png[m2p_adbd.png]

. On PC terminal:

- If adbd was succeed to set up, insert OTG-USB interface to M3 and PC(with Ubuntu system)
- Execute
+
```sh
adb devices
```
to see if PC has recognised M3 OTG
- If yes, we could execute
+
```sh
adb shell
```
to connect M3 by adb now
+

=== LCD 5" & LCD 7"
- Execute
+
```sh
bpi-bootsel
```
you'll see a list of boot files.Find "**BPI_M3_LCD7.img.gz**"

- Then execute

+
```sh
iperf3 -c serverIP
```
- UDP test
+
```sh
iperf3 -u -c serverIP
```
