**Linux PC**

**There are two methods for you to choose from.**

. Install Image with dd command on Linux, umount SDcard device /dev/sdX partition if mounted automatically. Actually bpi-copy is the same as this dd command.
+
```sh
 $ sudo apt-get install pv unzip
 $ sudo unzip -p xxx-bpi-m64-xxx.img.zip | pv | dd of=/dev/sdX bs=10M status=noxfer
```
. Install image with bpi-tools on Linux, plug SDcard to Linux PC and run
+
```sh
 $ sudo apt-get install pv unzip
 $ sudo bpi-copy xxx-bpi-m64-xxx.img.zip /dev/sdX
```

=== Install Image to EMMC
. Prepare a SDcard with Linux image flashed and bootup board with this SDcard.
. Unzip the image and copy it to a USB drive, plug the udisk to board and mount it.（If automatically mounted, ignore this step）
+
```sh
mount /dev/sdx /mnt
```
. There are two ways to install the linux image to board.
- Install with dd command.
+
```sh
sudo dd if=/mnt/xxx.bpi-p2_zero-xxx.img of=/dev/mmcblk0 bs=10M status=noxfer
```
- Install the linux image in udisk with bpi-tools command
+
```sh
 $ sudo bpi-copy xxx-bpi-p2_zero-xxx.img.zip /dev/mmcblk0
```
. After download complete, power off safely and eject the SDcard.

=== Switch to LCD boot type
. The default release images are HDMI boot type, you can switch to LCD boot type for BPI 7" LCD support after first boot.
+
```sh
 $ sudo bpi-bootsel /usr/lib/u-boot/bananapi/bpi-m64/BPI-M64-LCD7-linux4.4-8k.img.gz
 $ reboot
```
. Load the Touchscreen driver if you want to using TP
+
```sh
 $ sudo modprobe gt9xxnew_ts.ko
```

=== Build Linux source code
Get the bsp source code
```SH
 $ git clone https://github.com/BPI-SINOVOIP/BPI-M64-bsp-4.4
```

== Other development
=== GMAC
Use iperf3 to test gmac

. On PC Terminal:
+
- Execute
+
```sh
iperf3 -s
```

. On M2U console:
+
--
- TCP test: 
+
```sh
iperf3 -c serverIP
```
- UDP test: 
+
```sh
iperf3 -u -c serverIP
```
--

=== Bluetooth
-  Use bluetoothctl tool to operate BT
- Execute 
+
```sh
bluetoothctl
```
- If you don't know how to use bluetoothctl, type "**help**", you will see more commands
- Execute these commands:
+

=== WiFi
==== WiFi Client

**You have two ways to setup WiFi Client**

. Use commands to setup WiFi client
+
```sh
ip link set wlan0 up
iw dev wlan0 scan | grep SSID
vim /etc/wpasupplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf
```
+
```sh
 network={    
 ssid="ssid"    
 psk="password"    
 priority=1 
 }
```
+
```sh
wpa_supplicant -iwlan0 -c /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf
dhclient wlan0
```
. Use UI interface to setup WiFi Client

==== Ap Mode
. Install hostapd and create hostapd configuration file hostapd.conf:
+
```sh
interface=wlan0
driver=nl80211
ssid=test
hw_mode=g
channel=1
```
. Execute command
+
```sh
hostapd -d /<path>/hostapd.conf
```
- If you meet problem like this：
+
image::/picture/a64_ap_1.png[a64_ap_1.png]

- Then, you could solve by following command：
+
```sh
nmcli radio wifi off
```
+
image::/picture/a64_ap_2.png[a64_ap_2.png]
+
```sh
rfkill unblock 1
rfkill unblock 2
ifconfig wlan0 up
hostapd -d hostapd.conf
```
+

=== Clear boot
```sh
git clone https://github.com/BPI-SINOVOIP/BPI-files/tree/master/SD/100MB
bpi-bootsel BPI-cleanboot-8k.img.gz /dev/sdX
```

=== GPIO Control
. To access a GPIO pin you first need to export it with
+
```sh
 echo XX > /sys/class/gpio/export
```

. with XX being the number of the desired pin. To obtain the correct number you have to calculate it from the pin name (like PH18)
+
NOTE: (position of letter in alphabet - 1) * 32 + pin number +
for PH18 this would be ( 8 - 1) * 32 + 18 = 224 + 18 = 242 (since 'h' is the 8th letter)
+
```sh
echo "out/in" > /sys/class/gpio/gpio*NUMBER*/direction
echo "0/1" > /sys/class/gpio/gpio*NUMBER*/value
```

=== Camara function
We use HDF5640 camara.

image::/picture/ov5640_camara.png[ov5640_camara.png]

**Guvcview**

Use your UI interface to operate camara

Applications -> Sound & Video -> guvcview

**Shell**

We also have built-in command in "/usr/local/bin" to test camara

- Test picture taking function
+
```sh
./test_ov5640_image_mode.sh
```
- Test video recording function
+
```sh
./cameratest.sh
```

**IR function**

- Execute
+
```sh
getevent
```
- Use your IR device to send information to A64

=== RPi.GPIO
**Install RPi.GPIO**

```sh
git clone https://github.com/BPI-SINOVOIP/RPi.GPIO
cd RPi.GPIO
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python-dev python3-dev
```
