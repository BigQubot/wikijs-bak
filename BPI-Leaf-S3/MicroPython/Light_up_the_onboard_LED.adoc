After completing link:/en/BPI-Leaf-S3/MicroPython/environment[Install and configure the Thonny], you can try programming immediately.

Create a new main.py script file and enter the following code in it:

```py
from machine import Pin
from neopixel import NeoPixel
import time
pin_48 = Pin(48)
np = NeoPixel(pin_48, 1, bpp=3, timing=1)
while True:
     np[0] = (25,25,25)
     np. write()
     time. sleep_ms(250)
     np[0] = (0,0,0)
     np. write()
     time. sleep_ms(250)
```

Save the file to the MicroPython device, click the "Run" button to make the onboard colored LED flash.

Modify the data in the tuple on the right side of `np[0] = (25,25,25)` to change the color, which corresponds to the brightness levels of R, G, and B respectively. The setting range is 0-255, and the recommended range is 0-25. When the brightness is too high, please do not look directly at it for a long time!
