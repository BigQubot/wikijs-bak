= Description

The BPI-9460 series of modules are designed to extract power from a conventional twisted pair Category 5 Ethernet cable, conforming to the IEEE 802.3af Power-over-Ethernet(PoE) standard. The BPI-9460 signature and control circuit provides the PoE compatibility signature and power classification required by the Power Sourcing Equipment (PSE) before applying up to 15W power to the port. The RT9460 provides a Class 0 signature.The DC/DC converter operates over a wide input voltage range and provides a regulated output. The DC/DC converter also has built-in short-circuit output protection.

|Pin #	|Name	|Description
|1	|VA1	|RX Input (1). This input pin is used in conjunction with VA2 and connects to the centre tap of the transformer connected to pins 1&2 of the RJ45 connector (RX) - it is not polarity sensitive.BPI-9460S this pin is direct Input +. This pin connects to the positive (+) output of the input bridge rectifier.
|2	|VA2	|TX Input (2). This input pin is used in conjunction with VA1 and connects to the centre tap of the transformer connected to pins 3&6 of the RJ45 connector (TX) - it is not polarity sensitive.BPI-9460S this pin is direct Input -. This pin connects to the negative (-) output of the input bridge rectifier.
|3	|VB1	|Direct Input (1). This input pin is used in conjunction with VB2 and connects to pin 4 & 5 of the RJ45 connector - it is not polarity sensitive.BPI-9460S this pin is direct Input +. This pin connects to the positive (+) output of the input bridge rectifier.
|4	|VB2	|Direct Input (2). This input pin is used in conjunction with VB1 and connects to pin 7 & 8 of the RJ45 connector - it is not polarity sensitive.BPI-9460S this pin is direct Input -. This pin connects to the negative (-) output of the input bridge rectifier
|5	|-VDC	|DC Return. This pin is the return path for the +VDC output.
|6	|+VDC	|DC Output. This pin provides the regulated output from the DC/DC converter.

. Typical figures are at 25°C with a nominal 48V supply and are for design aid only. Not Guaranteed
. The output ripple and noise can be reduced with an external filter, see application note.
. Continuous short circuit duration is applicable at 25'C ambient temperature in free air. At higher temperatures or with restricted airflow (e.g. in a sealed enclosure) the duration will need to be limited to avoid overheating.
