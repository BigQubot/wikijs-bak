= Introduction

Banana Pi BPI-SM9 16-ENC-A3 deep learning computing module is equipped with the highly integrated computing technology processor BM1688 8 Core ARM CA53 1.6GHz, 8GB LPDDR4ï¼Œ32GB eMMC onboard. It has 1 RJ45 Gigabit network port, 1 M.2 Key E, 1 M.2 Key M, 4 USB3.2 ports, 1 TYPE C (USB3.0) and multiple functional interfaces.

== Specifications
* Supports HDMI 2.0 output;
* Supports dual gigabit RJ45 Ethernet;
* Supports dual-layer USB3.0 interfaces;
* Supports dual-layer WIFI_BT function;
* Supports TF card or M.2 SSD expansion;
* Supports 2 MIPI camera inputs;
* Supports expansion of GPIO;
* Supports CAN function;
* Supports USB-C interface upgrade (NVIDVI core board solution);

= Development

== Prepare

* 12V/3A power adapter(The voltage range is between 11 and 13 volts. Using a 12V power adapter is the most suitable option.)

* Using your USB-Serial cable(3.3V TTL,Baud=115200) Connect to debug console on BPI-SM9

* One TF card(If you want to use the FT card for system startup)

* One Type-C cable (for upgrade programming)

=== TTL Debugport

== Jumper caps and the function

=== TF card detection and GPIO selection
NOTE: JP7 jumper instructions: (For BM1688)
1. Default connection: PIN2 and PIN3, used for enabling control of the WIFI module in the BM1688/NVIDIA module;
2. When using the TF card function of BM1688, the jumper of PIN1 and PIN2 is required, used for detecting the insertion of the TF card in BM1688;
