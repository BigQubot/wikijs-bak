AIM开发套件支持多种系统镜像，我们可以根据自己需求选择相应的镜像下载

NOTE: 系统镜像包括了linux内核，基本的程序等，是运行AIM开发套件必须项，所以我们需要在运行产品前为产品安装镜像

== Obtaining the System Image

Visit the Baidu Cloud resource page to obtain the system image: 

Baidu Cloud Link: https://pan.baidu.com/share/init?surl=4qfAZM3QqgJPuFVjKRSBUw&pwd=arms

NOTE: 1,The default account/password for the official image is armsom/armsom, linaro/linaro, root/1234. +
2,The Debian system is adapted and compiled using the SDK provided by RK, making it more suitable for users with ISP, GPU, codec, and NPU needs. It can be burned to eMMC using RKDevTool or to an SD card using SDDiskTool. +
3,Ubuntu, Armbian, and OpenWrt are additional options provided by ArmSoM for open-source enthusiasts.

==== Installing RKDevTool
* RKDevTool is a dedicated USB burning tool for Rockchip, available on the Windows platform, which can be used to download system images to the product via the USB interface.

* After unzipping the package, you can use it without installation. Double-click RKDevTool.exe to enter the software interface.

* The software mainly has three sections: Download Image (burn image by address), Upgrade Firmware, and Advanced Functions.

==== Burning Image in MASKROM/Loader Mode

This mode is suitable for products that have not yet been burned with a system or where the burned system is damaged and cannot run (suitable for all situations).

Open the RKDevTool burning tool and set the product to burn mode.

Entering Loader Mode

* 1. Prepare a Type-C cable for burning the image.
* 2. Disconnect all cables that might power the product, such as the power cable, USB cable, etc.
* 3. Use a Type-C cable to connect the product's OTG interface to a USB port on the computer, then open the RKDevTool software.
* 4. Short pin 10 (FC REC) and pin 9 (GND) on the 12-pin connector, then power the product via DC.
* 5. Wait for the software to prompt "Loader device found" (as shown below), then release the buttons.
* 6. If unsuccessful, repeat steps 2-5.


Entering MASKROM Mode

== Burning Debian System

=== Using a Card Reader to Burn to microSD

Installing SDDiskTool

To burn the image to eMMC, you need to use the SDDiskTool_version.exe tool.

Click the following link to access it: https://pan.baidu.com/share/init?surl=4qfAZM3QqgJPuFVjKRSBUw&pwd=arms[Baidu Cloud Link]

image::/bpi-aim7/docs_aim_7.png[docs_aim_7.png]

After extracting the compressed file, you can use the software without installation. Simply double-click the SD_Firmware_Tool.exe file to open the tool.

=== Burning the Image

Open the SDDiskTool executable file (SD_Firmware_Tool.exe) and insert the SD card.

First, select the correct SD card you want to burn. Then, set the function mode to SD Boot and choose the image you want to burn. Finally, click the "Create" button to start creating the bootable SD card.

image::/bpi-aim7/docs_aim_8.png[docs_aim_8.png]

Please be patient as the SD card is being burned. The larger the image, the longer the burning process will take.

NOTE: 1.If you encounter an error saying it cannot burn the image after clicking "Create," try closing the error window and starting the creation process again. If that doesn’t work, try formatting the SD card. +
2.The firmware downloaded from Baidu Cloud must be extracted before it can be loaded. On a Windows PC, you need to run the tool with administrator privileges.

=== Using a USB Cable to Burn to eMMC

We will use the RKDevTool to burn the image and put the product into burning mode.

* 1. Prepare a Type-C cable for burning the image.
* 2. Disconnect all cables that might power the product, such as the power cord and USB cables.
* 3. Connect one end of the Type-C cable to the OTG port on the product and the other end to the USB port on the computer, then open the RKDevTool software.
* 4. Hold down the Recovery button and power the product using the DC supply.
* 5. Wait for the software to indicate that a LOADER device has been detected (as shown below), then release the button.
* 6. If unsuccessful, repeat steps 2-5.

image::/bpi-aim7/docs_aim_9.png[docs_aim_9.png]

image::/bpi-aim7/docs_aim_10.jpg[docs_aim_10.jpg]

The burning progress will be shown on the right. Once completed, the tool will notify you:

image::/bpi-aim7/docs_aim_11.png[docs_aim_11.png]

TIP: TROUBLESHOOTING BURNING FAILURES +
If you encounter a "Download Boot Fail" error or other errors during the burning process (as shown below), it is usually due to a poor USB connection, low-quality cables, or insufficient power from the computer’s USB port. Try replacing the USB cable or using a different USB port on the computer to troubleshoot.

NOTE: WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MASKROM MODE AND LOADER MODE? +
Maskrom Mode: When the Flash is not yet burned with firmware, the chip will enter Maskrom mode for the initial firmware burning. During development, if the Loader mode fails to start properly, Maskrom mode can also be used to burn the firmware. +
Loader Mode: This mode is triggered during the uboot startup when a specific pin is pressed. In Loader mode, firmware burning and upgrading can be performed. You can also burn individual partition images for easier debugging.
