= Prepare

== Prepare

Before you start using the development board, please have the following items ready:

* Prepare 8G/above TF card, USB-Serial cable.
* 12V/2A power adapter
* Connect the USB TypeC Console interface using the TypeC (cable.Baud=115200)Connect to debug console on BPI-RV2.

== Optional Accessories
* 5G module: RM520N-GL
* NVMe: Intel NVMe
* 4G module:EC25-E

= Burn image

== Ethernet burning image

1. Ready to burn, the board is connected to the serial port, and the computer network cable is connected to the network port on the board.

2. Open the serial port tool, restart the uboot, press enter Key to enter the command mode, enter the http://192.168.1.5 command (or other 23 ip address in the same network segment as the PC), press enter, the interface is as follows:

3. Open the browser and enter different urls as required. The following table uses 192.168.1.5 as an example:


[options="header",cols="1,1",width="70%"]
|=====
|IP address | Function
|192.168.1.5 |Burn firmware
|192.168.1.5/uboot.html |Burn uboot
|=====

The normal burning interface is as follows:

It restarts automatically after burning
 
NOTE: Q: How to deal with uboot burning failure +
A：If the uboot fails to be burned, the image cannot be updated through the uboot. You can download the image through the irom usb, or remove the flash and re-burn the image in mode of the burner

== Network Function Virtualization（DPNS）

Using Siflower NPU, the development board software supports IPV4/IPV6 dual stack data processing offload, including hardware switching, hardware routing, hardware NAT, hardware 50 ACL, traffic statistics, hardware QoS. Performance up to 64 byte small packet, full bandwidth forwarding. 

=== Function Introduction
- NPU supports six physical ports and internally maps all physical ports to virtual ports. And it supports 7 virtual ports.port0~port3 is qsgmii port,port4 is xsgmii port, port5 is rgmii port and port 6 is host interface.
- dpns supports packet acceleration of layer 2, layer 3, multicast packet acceleration, pppoe packet acceleration and other functions.
- support nat.
- support vlan and double layer vlan replacement.
- support flow-based rate limiting.
- Support acl, including traffic mirroring, filtering, overlay sending, packet rate limit and other common functions.

== PCIE interface development board support

M2 interface and Mini Pcie interface, both PCIe gen 2 x1, PCIE debugging reference:

=== M2 KEY B

In this interface, you can use either 5G module or NVMe.

Connect RM520N to the interface

```


== POE (Power supply function Power supply)
BPI-RV2 can be PoE powered through a 2.5GbE port.

You'll need a BPI-RV2 board, a POE switch, and a network cable.

Connect the WAN port of BPI-RV2 and the POE power supply port of the switch with the network cable.The network cable is then ready to power the BPI-RV2.

== Double flash boot

The default start flash was selected by jumping the cap, and the SPI0 CS was connected as the default start flash.

== Encryption and decryption module function

The encryption and decryption module supports AES/RSA/MD5/SHA, which has been connected to the linux crypto subsystem, and the specific use method is referred to


== USB function

BPI-RV2 supports usb2.0 functions, and three usb ports are expanded through the usb hub chip, including M2 interface, mini pcie interface, and USB 78 TYPE-A host port. usb debugging reference:


== GPIO function

BPI-RV2 reserves some pins for GPIO, PWM and other interface control. For details, please refer to the documentation:
