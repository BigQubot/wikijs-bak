. To set a static IP, you need to maintain the connection first. If you want to set an Ethernet static IP, you must first maintain the Ethernet connection; if you want to set a wireless network static IP, you must first maintain a connection to a WIFI.
. If the upper-level router has assigned the IP address you want to set to other devices, please change it to an idle IP, or ask other devices to give up the IP.
. Use the nmcli connection show command to display all connections, for example:
+
```sh
  pi@bpi-m4zero:~$ nmcli connection show
  NAME UUID TYPE DEVICE
  TP-LINK_5G_7747 e4a49726-adf1-44d7-a621-0e3af96cc390 wifi wlx2cc3e6acd5d7
  Wired connection 1 612eda94-55dc-3c85-b05e-f16c41775b4e ethernet --
```
. Use the nmcli connection show [NAME] command to display all the properties of a specific connection, such as:
+
```sh
  nmcli connection show TP-LINK_5G_7747
```
 If you want to see Ethernet, change to Wired connection 1
+
Only list three common items
+
```sh
  ipv4.dns: 192.168.3.1
  ipv4.addresses: 192.168.3.10/24
  ipv4.gateway: 192.168.3.1
```
- The default is the gateway address
- The default is the IP address assigned by the router DHCP
- Gateway address, the default is the IP address of the router

. Set static IP:
+
```sh
  nmcli connection modify TP-LINK_5G_7747 ipv4.addresses 192.168.3.2
```
. Set DNS:
+
```sh
  nmcli connection modify TP-LINK_5G_7747 ipv4.dns 8.8.8.8
```
. Reset:
+
```sh
  reboot
```

== Transfer files
**scp**

scp (secure copy) command in Linux system is used to copy file(s) between servers in a secure way.

The SCP command or secure copy allows the secure transferring of files between the local host and the remote host or between two remote hosts.

It uses the same authentication and security as it is used in the Secure Shell (SSH) protocol.

You can copy files from a Windows terminal to a Linux system on the same LAN. Just make sure the Open SSH client is turned on and can be viewed in Settings > Applications > Optional Features.

If you want to copy files from Windows systems to Linux systems, you also need to enable the Open SSH server.

image::/picture/bpi_m4_berry_mobaxterm_6.jpg[bpi_m4_berry_mobaxterm_6.jpg]
The scp command format is:
```sh
scp [optionals] file_source file_target
```
. [optionals] is an optional parameter, such as -r, which can be used to copy the entire directory recursively.
. file_source The file or directory to be copied.
. file_target will copy the past path and rename it if a specific file name is entered at the end.

Take copying local files from a Windows system to a Linux system as an example. In the Windows terminal, enter:
```sh
PS D:\temp\temp_4> scp ".\hello.txt" pi@192.168.3.12:"/home/pi/Downloads/"
```
You can also copy files in the Linux system to the local computer in the Windows terminal:
```sh
PS D:\temp\temp_4> scp pi@192.168.3.12:"/home/pi/Downloads/hello.txt" "D:\temp\temp_4"
```
- Where pi@192.168.3.12 is the user name in the Linux system and the IP address of the BPI-M4 Zero in the LAN.
- Where :"/home/pi/Downloads/hello.txt" is the file path in the Linux system.
- Where "D:\temp\temp_4" is the path in Windows system.
link:https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/scp-command-in-linux-with-examples/[scp reference document]

**mobaxterm**

Files can be managed through a graphical interface using mobaxterm or other similar software.

link:https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/download.html[mobaxterm download] +
link:https://download.mobatek.net/mobaxterm-on-linux.html[mobaxterm-linux preview version]

As shown in the figure below, after establishing an SSH connection in mobaxterm, a file management window will appear on the left side of the interface, which supports copying and pasting by dragging and dropping files.
