= Heat Dissipation Summary
== Core board heat dissipation 
The Raspberry Pi CM4 heatsink is a cooling accessory specifically designed for the Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4, which can effectively solve its heating problem and ensure the stable operation of the device.
[options="header",cols="10,4,10,10,6",width="100%"]
|=====
Component |Bare Board |CPUBare Board |DDRBare Board eMMC|With Heat Sink|
Temperature after 5 minutes of testing |81.4°C |66.8°C |60.9°C |55.7°C| 
Temperature at end of testing          |79.8°C |64.7°C |59.5°C |52.6°C|
|=====
NOTE: Based on the test temperatures, it can be observed that the temperature with a heat sink is 10-20°C lower than that of the bare board.

== AI model heat dissipation
[options="header",cols="10,4,10,10,6",width="100%"]
|=====
AI Workload	|Bare Board CPU|	Bare Board DDR|	Bare Board eMMC|	With Heat Sink|
Camera AI Recognition |	69.5°C  |	59.0°C  | 54.3°C  |51.2°C |
Video AI Recognition	| 95.9°C	| 75.3°C	| 66.8°C	|61.2°C |
|=====
NOTE: The cooling effect of the heat sink is significantly more pronounced during AI model execution. Temperatures with the heat sink are 10-30°C lower compared to the bare board configuration.

= Interface Settings
If you are using Banana Pi BPI-F4 Pro for the first time, please familiarize yourself with the Peripheral Interfaces for better understanding of the following content.

== Ethernet Port

* 1.First, plug one end of the network cable into the Ethernet port, and connect the other end to a router. Ensure that the network is functional.
* 2.After the system boots, it will automatically assign an IP address to the Ethernet port without any additional configuration.
* 3.To check the IP address, use the following command:

```sh
pi@ubuntu:~$ ifconfig
eth0: flags=4163<UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,MULTICAST>  mtu 1500
        inet 192.168.1.114  netmask 255.255.255.0  broadcast 192.168.1.255

```

* 4.Use the ping tool to check network connectivity.

** The command to test network connectivity is shown below. You can stop the ping command with the Ctrl+C shortcut.

```sh
pi@ubuntu:~$ sudo ping www.baidu.com

== WIFI
=== Connecting to WIFI via Command Line on Server Image

1.First...

2.Use the nmcli dev wifi command to scan for available WIFI hotspots:

1. Enable WIFI
```sh
nmcli r wifi on
```
2. Scan for WIFI
```sh
nmcli dev wifi
```

3. Connect to a WIFI network
```sh
nmcli dev wifi connect "wifi_name" password "wifi_password"
```

=== Testing Method for Desktop Image
1.Click the network configuration icon on the desktop (ensure not to connect a network cable while testing WIFI).

2.After connecting to WIFI, open a browser to check if you can access the internet

== BT

== HDMI
[options="header",cols="1,1"]
|====
|HDMI output interface	|Supports 1080p, 720p, 480p resolutions
|====

Connect the board to an HDMI display using an HDMI cable.

After booting the Linux system, if the HDMI display shows an image, the HDMI interface is functioning correctly.

NOTE: that many laptops, while having HDMI ports, typically have HDMI output only and do not support HDMI in. This means you cannot display the HDMI output from another device on the laptop's screen. Before connecting the development board's HDMI to a laptop's HDMI port, ensure your laptop supports HDMI in functionality. If there is no display, first check if your system is a desktop version; server versions might only show a terminal.

* 1.HDMI to VGA Display Test
** Required accessories: HDMI to VGA converter
* 2.A VGA cable and a display with a VGA port

The HDMI to VGA display test is shown below:

image::/bpi-f4/bpi-f4_hdmi.jpg[bpi-f4_hdmi.jpg]

== USB
The BPI-F4 provides one USB 3.0 Type-A, one USB 3.0 Type-C and one USB 2.0 Type-A.

image::/bpi-f4/bpi-f4_usb.png[bpi-f4_usb.png]

NOTE: Note that USB 3.0 Type-A and Type-C share with the same USB 3.0 port of SP7350, and they cannot be used simultaneously. Plug in a jumper to select USB 3.0 Type C socket.Otherwise, USB 3.0 Type A socket is selected. 

=== Using USB Mouse or Keyboard

* 1.Insert a USB keyboard or mouse into the board's USB port.
* 2.Connect the board to an HDMI display.
* 3.If the mouse or keyboard operates the system normally, the USB interface is working correctly (the mouse will only work in desktop versions of the system).

=== Using USB Storage Device
* 1.Insert a USB flash drive or USB external hard drive into the product's USB port.

* 2.Run the following command; if you see sdX output, the USB drive is recognized successfully: insertpng
```sh
sunplus@ubuntu:~$ cat /proc/partitions | grep "sd*"
major minor  #blocks  name
   8        0    3932160 sda
```
* 3.Use the mount command to mount the USB drive to /mnt and view the files on the USB drive: insertpng
```sh
sunplus@ubuntu:/dev$ sudo mkdir /test
sunplus@ubuntu:/dev$ sudo mount /dev/sda /test/
```

* 4.After mounting, use the df -h command to check the USB drive's capacity usage and mount point: insertpng
```sh
sunplus@ubuntu:/dev$ df -h | grep "sd"
/dev/sda        3.8G   16K  3.8G   1% /test
```
