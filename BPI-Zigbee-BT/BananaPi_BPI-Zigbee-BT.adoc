= Introduction

BPI Zigbee BT5.0 IoT module use Silicon Labs’Mighty Gecko MGM12P32F1024GE-V2 module onboard design.

Silicon Labs’Mighty Gecko MGM12P module integrates our EFR32MG12 Mighty Gecko SoC into a small form factor module for zigbee, Thread and Bluetooth low energy (LE) networks. With 1024 kB of Flash and 256 kB of RAM, this module is ideal for applications that require multiple protocols. Modules enable the fastest time to market and are ideal for lower volume (< 100K) applications. The fully certified modules integrate all components (Crystals, RF passives and Antenna) required for a system-level implementation of zigbee, Thread and BLE networks. With +10 dBm and +17 dBm versions, the modules can meet the WW regulatory requirements for IEEE 802.15.4 2.4 GHz used in both zigbee and Thread networks as well 2GFSK used in BLE networks.
