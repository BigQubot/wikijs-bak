Based on the previous section, we can go one step further and write a loop to automatically change the color of the lamp bead.

```py
from machine import Pin
from neopixel import NeoPixel
import time

def rainbow(num=1,level=25,delay=100):
     def write_all(num,delay,red,green,blue):
         for j in range (num):
             np[j] = (red,green,blue)
         np. write()
         time. sleep_ms(delay)
    
     red,green,blue = level,0,0
    
     rainbow_step_list2 = [(0,1,0),(-1,0,0),(0,0,1),(0,-1,0),(1,0,0),(0,0, -1)]
    
     for step in rainbow_step_list2:
         for i in range (level):
             red+=step[0]
             green+=step[1]
             blue+=step[2]
             write_all(num,delay,red,green,blue)
            


np = NeoPixel(Pin(48, Pin.OUT), 1,bpp=3, timing=1)

while True:
     rainbow(num=1,level=25,delay=10)

```
This routine can be applied to ws2812 light strips of any length.

Modify the first parameter in `NeoPixel(Pin(48, Pin.OUT), 1,bpp=3, timing=1)` to any GPIO pin that you want to connect the light strips in series.

Modify the num parameter in `rainbow(num=1,level=25,delay=100)` to be the number of corresponding lamp beads on the light strip.

Of course, we can also use for loop or while loop to make the color change pattern we want according to our own ideas.
