We compiled this Getting Started Guide to help you get started with this
BPI-PicoW-S3 development board quickly.

== First Thing

Use a USB-C cable with power and data functions to connect the
BPI-Centi-S3 development board to your computer.

A `CIRCUITPY` disk will reappear on the computer file management page.

> BPI-PicoW-S3 is pre-installed with **tinyUF2** and **CircuitPython** firmware out of box. It is recommended to use CircuitPython to quickly get started with the BPI-PicoW-S3 development board as it is considered to be the most beginners friendly platform.
