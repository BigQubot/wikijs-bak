+
image::/picture/m2u-android-emmc.png[m2u-android-emmc.png]

. After the image is burned, insert the SD card into the board and power on to start.After startup, the image will be automatically burned to the EMMC.
.  After the burning is completed, the power will be cut off, and the SD card will be removed. Power on again to start from EMMC.

== Linux
=== Prepare

. Linux image support SDcard or EMMC bootup
. It’s recommended to use A1 rated cards, 8GB at least.
. M2 Ultra and M2 Berry are compatiable with same Linux image.
. Install bpi-tools on your Linux PC(if flash image with other tools, ignore this step). If you can't access this URL or any other install problem, please go to link:https://github.com/bpi-sinovoip/bpi-tools[bpi-tools] source repo, download and install this tools manually.
+
```sh
 $ apt-get install pv
 $ curl -sL https://github.com/BPI-SINOVOIP/bpi-tools/raw/master/bpi-tools | sudo -E bash
```
. Download latest Linux Image, and confirm that the md5 checksum is correct.
. Default login: pi/bananapi or root/bananapi

=== Install Image to SDcard
**Windows PC**

Install Image with Balena Etcher. +
link:https://balena.io/etcher[Balena Etcher] is an opensource GUI flash tool by Balena, Flash OS images to SDcard or USB drive.

. Click on "**Flash from file**" to select image. 
. Click on "**Select target**" to select USB device. 
. Click on "**Flash!**" Start burning.

image::/picture/etcher.jpg[etcher.jpg]

**Linux PC**

**There are three methods for you to choose from.**

. Install Image with Balena Cli. +
link:https://github.com/balena-io/balena-cli[Balena CLI] is a Command Line Interface for balenaCloud or openBalena. It can be used to flash linux image. Download the installer or standalone package from link:https://github.com/balena-io/balena-cli/releases[balena-io] and link:https://github.com/balena-io/balena-cli/blob/master/INSTALL.md[install ]it correctly to your PC, then you can use the "link:https://docs.balena.io/reference/balena-cli/#local-flash-image[local flash]" command option of balena to flash a linux image to sdcard or usb drive.
+
```sh
 $ sudo balena local flash path/to/xxx-bpi-m5-xxx.img.zip
 $ sudo balena local flash path/to/xxx-bpi-m5-xxx.img.zip --drive /dev/disk2
 $ sudo balena local flash path/to/xxx-bpi-m5-xxx.img.zip --drive /dev/disk2 --yes
```

. Install Image with dd command on Linux, umount SDcard device /dev/sdX partition if mounted automatically. Actually bpi-copy is the same as this dd command.
+
```sh
 $ sudo apt-get install pv unzip
 $ sudo unzip -p xxx-bpi-m5-xxx.img.zip | pv | dd of=/dev/sdX bs=10M status=noxfer
```
. Install image with bpi-tools on Linux, plug SDcard to Linux PC and run
+
```sh
 $ sudo apt-get install pv unzip
 $ sudo bpi-copy xxx-bpi-m5-xxx.img.zip /dev/sdX
```

=== Install Image to eMMC

. Prepare a SDcard with Linux image flashed and bootup board with this SDcard.
. Unzip the image and copy it to a USB drive, plug the udisk to board and mount it.（If automatically mounted, ignore this step）
+
```sh
mount /dev/sdx /mnt
```
. There are two ways to install the linux image to board.
- Install with dd command.
+
```sh
sudo dd if=/mnt/xxx.bpi-m2-ultra-xxx.img of=/dev/mmcblk0 bs=10M status=noxfer
```
- Install the linux image in udisk with bpi-tools command
+
```sh
 $ sudo bpi-copy xxx-bpi-m2-ultra-xxx.img.zip /dev/mmcblk0
```
. After download complete, power off safely and eject the SDcard.

== Advanced Development
=== How to build uboot & kernel
**Install tools**
```sh
apt-get udpate
apt-get install gcc-arm-linux-gnueabihf u-boot-tools
apt-get install pv
curl -sL https://github.com/BPI-SINOVOIP/bpi-tools/raw/master/bpi-tools | sudo -E bash
```

**Clone code**
```sh
git clone: https://github.com/BPI-SINOVOIP/BPI-M2U-bsp.git
./build.sh
```

=== SATA
. Mount SATA on M2U
+
image::/picture/m2u_sata.png[m2u_sata.png]
+
After insert sata interface, execute "fdisk -l"
+
image::/picture/m2u_sata_fdisk_l.png[m2u_sata_fdisk_l.png]
+
Then "**mount /dev/sdx /mnt/xxx**"
. If you meet some errors when you mount SATA, try these following commands:
+
- “**fdisk /dev/sdx**” to create new partition , set your partition numbers and size, after created partitions, input “**wq**” to save and quit.
- “**mkfs.ext2 /dev/sdx**” to format the SATA
- “**mount /dev/sdx /mnt/xxx**”
. After you success to insert SATA, we could input following commands to test SATA interface:
- “**time dd if=/dev/xxx of=/dev/null bs=1M count=1000**” to test read speed
- “**time dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdx bs=1M count=1000**” to test write speed
+
image::/picture/sata_test.png[sata_test.png]

=== OTG
. On M2U console:
+
Execute “**/usr/local/bin/adbd.sh**” then execute “**ps -ax | grep adbd**” to see if adbd is set up
+
image::/picture/m2p_adbd.png[m2p_adbd.png]

. On PC terminal:
+
- If adbd was succeed to set up, insert OTG-USB interface to M2U and PC(with Ubuntu system)
- Execute ”**adb devices**“ to see if PC has recognised M2U OTG
- If yes, we could execute “**adb shell**” to connect M2U by adb now
+
