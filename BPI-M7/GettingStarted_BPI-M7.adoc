== Fan
The BPI-M7 features a 5V fan using a 0.8mm connector

Currently, the fan has five default states:

|====
|Temperature State |PWM |Speed
|>50°	|0	|0
|50°-55°	|1	|50
|55°-60°	|2	|100
|60°-65°	|3	|150
|65°-70°	|4	|200
|70°<	|5	|250
|====


```sh 
# Check the current speed
cat /sys/class/hwmon/hwmon9/pwm1 
```
== Type-C
The BPI-M7 features a full-featured USB Type‐C 3.1 port which supports up to 4Kp60 DP display.

== 40Pin
The BPI-M7 provides a 40-pin GPIO header, compatible with most sensors on the market.

== RGB LED
The BPI-M7 has two user LEDs - green and red.

* User Green LED,Constantly indicates running kernel by default.
* User Red LED Off by default, can be controlled by user.

Users can control with commands:
```sh 
armsom@armsom-sige7:/# sudo su  
armsom@armsom-sige7:/# echo timer > /sys/class/leds/red/trigger  
armsom@armsom-sige7:/# echo activity > /sys/class/leds/red/trigger
```
== RTC
* The BPI-M7 features an hym8563 RTC chip.
* First, insert the RTC battery using the 2-pin header to supply power to the RTC IC.
* Note that we should keep the RTC battery in the RTC connector and confirm the rtc hym8563 device which has been created.
+
```sh 
armsom@armsom-sige7:/# dmesg | grep rtc  
[ 6.407133] rtc-hym8563 6-0051: rtc information is valid  
[ 6.412731] rtc-hym8563 6-0051: registered as rtc0  
[ 6.413779] rtc-hym8563 6-0051: setting system clock to 2022-06-22T01:22:26 UTC (1655860946)  
```
* Find rtc0, then use the following commands to set system time and sync to rtc0:
+
```sh 
armsom@armsom-sige7:/# hwclock -r  
2023-11-03 10:32:40.461910+00:00  
armsom@armsom-sige7:/# date  
Fri 3rd Nov 10:33:12 UTC 2023
armsom@armsom-sige7:/# hwclock -w  
armsom@armsom-sige7:/# hwclock -r  
armsom@armsom-sige7:/# poweroff  
```
* Turn off the RTC battery for 10+ minutes, insert the battery again and boot Sige7, and check if RTC synced with system clock:
+
```sh 
armsom@armsom-sige7:/# hwclock -r  
2023-11-03 10:35:40.461910+00:00  
armsom@armsom-sige7:/# date
Fri 3rd Nov 10:36:01 UTC 2023
```

== M.2
The BPI-M7 provides an M.2 connector:

* There is an M.2 M Key connector on the back with a 4-lane PCIe 3.0 interface. The board has a standard M.2 2280 mounting hole to deploy M.2 2280 NVMe SSDs.
+
WARNING: Note: This M.2 interface does NOT support M.2 SATA SSDs.
+
```sh 
armsom@armsom-sige7:/# mkdir temp  
armsom@armsom-sige7:/# mount /dev/nvme0n1 temp
```

== Camera
**MIPI-CSI**

Use the IMX415 module for the camera. After connecting and powering on the camera module you can view the boot log:
```sh 
armsom@armsom-sige7:/# dmesg | grep imx415  
[ 2.547754] imx415 3-001a: driver version: 00.01.08

```
Use v4l2-ctl for image capture:
```sh 
// MIPI-CSI1  
armsom@armsom-sige7:/# v4l2-ctl -d /dev/video31 --set-fmt-video=width=3840,height=2160,pixelformat=NV12 --stream-mmap=3 --stream-skip=60 --stream-to=/tmp/cif73.out --stream-count=3 --stream-poll  

// MIPI-CSI2
armsom@armsom-sige7:/# v4l2-ctl -d /dev/video22 --set-fmt-video=width=3840,height=2160,pixelformat=NV12 --stream-mmap=3 --stream-skip=60 --stream-to=/tmp/cif73.out --stream-count=3 --stream-poll

```
Record video directly with gst-launch-1.0:

```sh 
// MIPI-CSI1  
armsom@armsom-sige7:/# gst-launch-1.0 v4l2src device=/dev/video31 ! video/x-raw,format=NV12,width=3840,height=2160, framerate=30/1 ! xvimagesink  

// MIPI-CSI2
armsom@armsom-sige7:/# gst-launch-1.0 v4l2src device=/dev/video22 ! video/x-raw,format=NV12,width=3840,height=2160, framerate=30/1 ! xvimagesink
```
