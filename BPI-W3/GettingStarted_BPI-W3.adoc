== Wlan&BT
J14 M.2 KEY E Slot is used for connect Wlan&BT adapter, default image support RTL8822CE(PCIE+USB) and RTL8822CS(SDIO+UART).

== Connect WiFi
=== Command line connection
. Open WiFi:
+
```sh
sudo nmcli r wifi on
```
. List wifi list:
+
```sh
sudo nmcli dev wifi list
```
. Connect to wifi
+
SSID is BPI, password is bananapi, using the wlan0 interface as an example.
+
```sh
sudo nmcli dev wifi connect BPI password bananapi ifname wlan0
```

=== Command line graphical connection
- Enter graphics configuration
+
```sh
sudo nmtui
```
- Move the keyboard arrow keys to Active a connection and press Enter to enter wifi settings

- Move the arrow keys to the wifi you want to connect to and press Enter

- If you are connecting to an unconnected hotspot with a password, you will enter the password input interface.

- If you want to disconnect from wifi, press the Enter key when connected to disconnect.

=== Desktop connection
Open WiFi, select the one you want to connect to, click and enter the password.

== Static network
=== nmtui
Set the ip address before the static address
```sh
sudo ifconfig
enP4p65s0: flags=4163<UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,MULTICAST> mtu 1500
        inet 192.168.10.100 netmask 255.255.255.0 broadcast 192.168.10.255
        ether 92:be:6d:d5:e7:b4 txqueuelen 1000 (Ethernet)
        RX packets 23758 bytes 1774543 (1.6 MiB)
        RX errors 0 dropped 80 overruns 0 frame 0
        TX packets 67013 bytes 3879463 (3.6 MiB)
        TX errors 0 dropped 0 overruns 0 carrier 0 collisions 0
        device interrupt 155
```
If you want to successfully set a static address, you need to pay attention to whether the IP address you want to set is occupied by other devices. You can use ping to set the static address. If there is data returned, it proves that the IP address is occupied by other devices.

The following are detailed steps

. Enter graphics configuration
+
```sh
nmtui
```
Move the keyboard arrow keys to Edit a connection and press Enter to enter the wifi settings.

. Select the network you want to edit, here we take eth0 as an example
Enter to see the default configuration of the network
+
image::/picture/nmtui-network-ip.jpg[nmtui-network-ip.jpg]

. Need to set IPV4 CONFIGURATION to Manual
. Then move the cursor to show and press enter to enter detailed configuration

Here we take the IP address 192.168.10.13 and the gateway 192.168.10.1 as an example.


NOTE: NOTE:The IP address and gateway need to be configured according to your actual network conditions. If you copy the configuration here, there is a high chance that your product will not be able to connect to the Internet. Junior developers recommend changing the static IP to a dynamically obtained IP.

**How to obtain the gateway**

. Set the network to automatically obtain IP
. After successfully obtaining the IP, use the command
+
```sh
route
```
result
+
```sh
 root@w3:/home/armsom# route
 Kernel IP routing table
 Destination Gateway Genmask Flags Metric Ref Use Iface
 default 192.168.10.1 0.0.0.0 UG 100 0 0 enP4p65s0
 192.168.10.0 0.0.0.0 255.255.255.0 U 100 0 0 enP4p65s0
```
. Gateway is our gateway, use the following command
+
```sh
 route-n
```
result
+
```
 root@lubancat:~# route -n
 Kernel IP routing table
 Destination Gateway Genmask Flags Metric Ref Use Iface
 default 192.168.10.1 0.0.0.0 UG 100 0 0 enP4p65s0
 192.168.10.0 0.0.0.0 255.255.255.0 U 100 0 0 enP4p65s0
```
- You can see our gateway address ---- 192.168.10.1
- 192.168.10.13/24 where /24 represents the mask 255.255.255.0,
- DNS servers Nationwide DNS–>114.114.114.114 Global DNS–>8.8.8.8
- Search domain can inherit DNS servers settings. Multiple DNS servers and search domains can be set.


. After setting up, you can move to the back and click OK to complete the setting.

. After completing the settings, you need to activate the settings for the network to take effect. Click Activate a connection to enter the connection, press enter once to cancel the connection, and press enter again to reconnect.

. The IP after the re -connection becomes the IP we set up
+
```sh
 root@w3:/home/armsom# ip addr
    lo: <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN group default qlen 1000
     link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00
     inet 127.0.0.1/8 scope host lo
        valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
    enP4p65s0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc mq state UP group default qlen 1000
     link/ether 92:be:6d:d5:e7:b4 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff permaddr be:87:f6:b4:e5:ad
     inet 192.168.10.13/24 brd 192.168.10.255 scope global noprefixroute enP4p65s0
        valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
    wlP2p33s0: <NO-CARRIER,BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP> mtu 1500 qdisc mq state DOWN group default qlen 1000
     link/ether 2c:05:47:8e:4a:6c brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
    wlan1: <NO-CARRIER,BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP> mtu 1500 qdisc mq state DOWN group default qlen 1000
     link/ether 2e:05:47:8e:4a:6c brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
```
We can also use ping baidu.com to check if we have successfully connected to the external network
+
```sh
 root@w3: $ ping baidu .com
 PING baidu.com (110.242.68.66) 56( 84) bvtes of data.
 64 bytes from 110.242.68.66 (110.242.68.66): icmp seg=1 ttl=50 time=41.9 ms
 64 bytes from 110.242.68.66 (110.242.68.66): icmp seg=2 ttl=50 time=54.2 ms
 64 bytes from 110.242.68.66 (110.242.68.66): icmp seg=3 ttl=50 time=45.8 ms
```

=== nmcli
Taking enP4p65s0 as an example, this step is similar to editing the network in nmtui, except that it changes from a graphical interface to a command line operation, with various names in the command line. This is only a partial introduction, and those interested can explore it on their own.

. First, list the configuration of the connection. eth0 is currently connected to Wired connection 1
+
```sh
root@w3:/home/armsom# nmcli c s
 NAME                UUID                                  TYPE      DEVICE
 Wired connection 1  e01f934d-7fae-344f-90bf-e2483db3f3e5  ethernet  enP4p65s0
 armsom                d3d9a6ff-9c9c-44f8-a366-6a69af1edd1a  wifi      --
 armsom 1              7867c3af-dca2-4e9a-9721-a20f7a0e1b46  wifi      --
```
. Then modify Wired connection 1 +
Static IP settings
+
```sh
 sudo nmcli c modify 'Wired connection 1'
 
 sudo nmcli c m 'Wired connection 1' ipv4.address 192.168.10.13/24
 sudo nmcli c m 'Wired connection 1' ipv4.method manual
 sudo nmcli c m 'Wired connection 1' ipv4.gateway 192.168.10.1
 sudo nmcli c m 'Wired connection 1' ipv4.dns 8.8.8.8 
 sudo nmcli c m 'Wired connection 1' +ipv4.dns 114.114.114.114 
 sudo nmcli c m 'Wired connection 1' ipv6.method disabled
 sudo nmcli c m 'Wired connection 1' connection.autoconnect yes
```
Note that IPv4.Address must be modified first before you can modify ipv4.Method!
. Activate configuration
 sudo nmcli c up ifname eth0
. After configuration, the IP changed
+
```sh
 root@w3:~$ ip addr
   lo: <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN group default qlen 1000
     link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00
     inet 127.0.0.1/8 scope host lo
        valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
   enP4p65s0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc mq state UP group default qlen 1000
     link/ether 92:be:6d:d5:e7:b4 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff permaddr be:87:f6:b4:e5:ad
     inet 192.168.10.14/24 brd 192.168.10.255 scope global noprefixroute enP4p65s0
        valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
   wlP2p33s0: <NO-CARRIER,BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP> mtu 1500 qdisc mq state DOWN group default qlen 1000
     link/ether 2c:05:47:8e:4a:6c brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
   wlan1: <NO-CARRIER,BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP> mtu 1500 qdisc mq state DOWN group default qlen 1000
     link/ether 2e:05:47:8e:4a:6c brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
```

== Ethernet
ArmSoM-w3 is configured with one 2.5G Ethernet interface. You can connect ArmSoM-w3 to the network using a network cable (one end is connected to an external network port or a route). The ArmSoM-w3 automatically configures the network for your Internet access.

Check that the Ethernet is working by using the ifconfig command, which displays network card eth0 or enP4p65s0, along with the Ethernet IP address. In addition, you can use the ping tool to test network connectivity.
```sh
ifconfig
ping www.google.com
```
If the network cable is connected, no IP address is assigned to the node.
```sh
dhclient eth0
```
or
```sh
dhclient enP4p65s0
```

=== HDMI RX
The ArmSoM-w3 uses an hdmi_in port built into the rk3588 chip,You can use the v4l2 command to test the hdmi in interface.

**View all video nodes**

```sh
ls /dev/video*
```
**Look for the rk hdmirx device**

Run the v4l2-ctl -d command to specify the vidoe node. Run the -D command to view the node information. Check the rk_hdmirx device using the Driver name.
```sh
# v4l2-ctl -d /dev/video0 -D
Driver Info:
Driver name : rk_hdmirx
Card type : rk_hdmirx

== NPU usage
**DEMO video**: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7mYxn3rq0U

**Prepare tools**

. Use the Ubuntu18.04 / Ubuntu20.04 operating system (OS).

. An W3-PRO board

**Preparation procedure**

- First make sure you have docker installed on your Ubuntu system,If not, refer to the Internet installation tutorial

- We provide the source code and the docker image of the installed environment:docker image

- Create a rknpu folder on the PC server and copy the firmware to the folder
+
```sh
rknpu/rknn-toolkit2-1.4.0/docker$ ls
md5sum.txt  rknn-toolkit2-1.4.0-cp36-docker.tar.gz  rknn-toolkit2-1.4.0-cp38-docker.tar.gz
```
- Run the following command to run the docker image. After the Docker image is run, the bash environment of the image is displayed
+
```sh
docker run -t -i --privileged -v /dev/bus/usb:/dev/bus/usb rknn-toolkit2:1.4.0-cp38 /bin/bash
```
- Map examples code into a Docker environment by attaching "-v <host src folder>:<image dst folder>"Parameters, such as:
+
```sh
docker run -t -i --privileged -v /dev/bus/usb:/dev/bus/usb -v /your/rknn-toolkit2-1.x.x/examples:/examples rknn-toolkit2:1.x.x /bin/bash
```
- The code is synchronized after mapping

- The rknn service needs to run on the development board

- BOARD ARCH corresponds to the aarch64 directory on 64-bit Linux systems and to the armhf directory on 32-bit systems

. adb push all files in Linux/rknn server/${B0ARD_ ARCH}/usr/bin/ to /usr/bin
. adb push Linux/librknn api/${BOARD ARCH}/ librknrnt. so to /usr/1ib
. Access the serial port terminal of the board and run the following command
+
```sh
chmod +x /usr/bin/rknn server
chmod +X /usr/bin/start_ rknn.sh
chmod +X /usr/bin/restart rknn.sh
restart_ rknn. sh

- Run python3 test.py

== LED
- On BPI-W3 three-color LED is configured as LED class device. When the blue LED is not active a green LED will show to indicate the board has power. You can control the behavior mode of the blue LED by writing to /sys/class/leds/blue:status/trigger. By default only root users can write to the device. The default mode of the blue LED is heartbeat.
+
```sh
linaro@linaro-alip:/home/linaro# sudo su // linaro password
root@linaro-alip:/home/linaro# echo timer > /sys/class/leds/blue:status/trigger
root@linaro-alip:/home/linaro# echo activity > /sys/class/leds/blue:status/trigger
```

- You can use cat on the trigger property to list all the available LED modes. The value in brackets is the currently active mode.
+
```sh
root@linaro-alip:/home/linaro# cat /sys/class/leds/blue:status/trigger
none rfkill-any rfkill-none kbd-scrolllock kbd-numlock kbd-capslock kbd-kanalock kbd-shiftlock kbd-altgrlock kbd-ctrllock kbd-altlock kbd-shiftllock kbd-shiftrlock kbd-ctrlllock kbd-ctrlrlock tcpm-source-psy-4-0022-online mmc2 mmc1 timer oneshot disk-activity disk-read disk-write ide-disk mtd nand-disk heartbeat backlight gpio cpu cpu0 cpu1 cpu2 cpu3 cpu4 cpu5 cpu6 cpu7 mmc0 [activity] default-on transient flash torch panic netdev rfkill0
```
- In the None mode, writing to /sys/class/leds/blue:status/brightness can manually control the status of the blue LED.
+
```sh
root@linaro-alip:/home/linaro# echo none > /sys/class/leds/blue:status/trigger
root@linaro-alip:/home/linaro# echo 1 > /sys/class/leds/blue:status/brightness
root@linaro-alip:/home/linaro# echo 0 > /sys/class/leds/blue:status/brightness
```
- red light is the same, class device /sys/class/leds/red:status/trigger

== RTC Device
BPI-W3 is equipped with one RTC IC hym8563

. Firstly, plug in RTC battery to give power to RTC IC. Please note that we should keep the RTC battery in the RTC connector.

. Secondly,Check whether the driver is successfully loaded.

== Overlays
The device tree Overlays make it possible to support multiple hardware configurations with a single kernel, without the need to explicitly load or mask kernel modules.

=== Ubuntu 22.04 Mirror Enable Overlay
The path for storing the overlay file of Ubuntu 22.04 image on the board side is:**/boot/firmware/dtbs/rockchip/overlay/*.dtbo**

Find the keyword "**overlays=**" in the **/boot/firmware/ubuntuEnv.txt** file. The following is an example of using two overlay layers for BPI-W3.
```sh
overlays=bananapi-w3-camera-imx415-4k bananapi-w3-display-mipi-dsi
```
After editing, restart the device to change the overlay settings.

=== Armbian Mirror Enable Overlay
The path for storing the overlay file of Armbian image on the board side is:**/boot/dtbs/rockchip/overlay/*.dtbo**

Find the keyword "**overlays=**" in the **/boot/armbianEnv.txt** file. The following is an example of using two overlay layers for BPI-W3.
```sh
overlays=bananapi-w3-camera-imx415-4k bananapi-w3-display-mipi-dsi
```
After editing, restart the device to change the overlay settings.

=== Prepare tools
. Use the Ubuntu18.04 / Ubuntu20.04 operating system (OS).

. An W3-PRO board

=== Preparation procedure
First make sure you have docker installed on your Ubuntu system,If not, refer to the Internet installation tutorial

We provide the source code and the docker image of the installed environment:link:https://pan.baidu.com/s/1qm7qPQ-6Cau7kVhf-T-hzg?pwd=1234[docker image]

Create a rknpu folder on the PC server and copy the firmware to the folder
```sh
rknpu/rknn-toolkit2-1.4.0/docker$ ls
md5sum.txt  rknn-toolkit2-1.4.0-cp36-docker.tar.gz  rknn-toolkit2-1.4.0-cp38-docker.tar.gz
```
Run the following command to run the docker image. After the Docker image is run, the bash environment of the image is displayed
```sh
docker run -t -i --privileged -v /dev/bus/usb:/dev/bus/usb rknn-toolkit2:1.4.0-cp38 /bin/bash
```
Map examples code into a Docker environment by attaching "-v <host src folder>:<image dst folder>"Parameters, such as:
```sh
docker run -t -i --privileged -v /dev/bus/usb:/dev/bus/usb -v /your/rknn-toolkit2-1.x.x/examples:/examples rknn-toolkit2:1.x.x /bin/bash
```
The code is synchronized after mapping

The rknn service needs to run on the development board

BOARD ARCH corresponds to the aarch64 directory on 64-bit Linux systems and to the armhf directory on 32-bit systems
```sh
 adb push all files in Linux/rknn server/${B0ARD_ ARCH}/usr/bin/ to /usr/bin
adb push Linux/librknn api/${BOARD ARCH}/ librknrnt. so to /usr/1ib
```
Access the serial port terminal of the board and run the following command
```sh
 chmod +x /usr/bin/rknn server
 chmod +X /usr/bin/start_ rknn.sh
 chmod +X /usr/bin/restart rknn.sh
 restart_ rknn. sh
```

=== Run program
Execute adb devices in the docker image first, remembering the adb ID number

Go to /examples/onnx/yolov5 and change test.py
```sh
ret = rknn.init_runtime(target='rk3588', device_id=DEVICE_ID, perf_debug=True,eval_mem=True)
outputs = rknn.inference(inputs=[img])
