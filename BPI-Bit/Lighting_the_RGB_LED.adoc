= How to lighting the RGB LED

== Install Library
. Install library from github:
+
Librarys:link:https://github.com/Makuna/NeoPixelBus[NeoPixel_Bus] from Makuna
+
Download libraries and put it in the libraries folder in the installation directory of the Arduino IDE

== Programe Code
- Open Arduino IDE
+
Click 'file'->'Example'->'NeoPixel Bus'->'simple' to open the example

- We need to change some code,Find the code below in the code
+
```sh
 const uint16_t PixelCount = 4; // this example assumes 4 pixels, making it smaller will cause a failure
 const uint8_t PixelPin = 2;  // make sure to set this to the correct pin, ignored for Esp8266
```
- Change to
+
```sh
 const uint16_t PixelCount = 25; // this example assumes 4 pixels, making it smaller will cause a failure
 const uint8_t PixelPin = 4;  // make sure to set this to the correct pin, ignored for Esp8266
```
- Then add the following code to void setup()
+
```sh
 #define LED_POWER      2
 pinMode(LED_POWER, OUTPUT);
 digitalWrite(LED_POWER, HIGH);
```
- Compile this program
