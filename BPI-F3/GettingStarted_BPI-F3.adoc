. Double click link:https://download.banana-pi.dev/d/ca025d76afd448aabc63/files/?p=%2FTools%2Fimage_download_tools%2Ftitantools_for_windows-1.0.35-beta.zip[**titantools_for_windows-latest**] to install. Linux grants executable permissions and can be run by opening link:https://download.banana-pi.dev/d/ca025d76afd448aabc63/files/?p=%2FTools%2Fimage_download_tools%2Ftitantools_for_linux-1.0.35-beta.zip[**titantools_for_Linux-latest**] without the need for installation.
. It is installed on the computer's C drive by default, and will require a certain amount of space for future use. **So please ensure that the remaining available space is greater than 10G (Linux has a Home space greater than 10GB)**
. Allow this app from unknown publishers to make changes to your device. Then choose to always install this driver software.



. If the driver installation is successful, it will prompt that the USB driver installation is successful.

**Burn image to EMMC**

. Click Single Machine Burn (If you need to burn multiple devices simultaneously, click Multiple Machine Burn)
+

. To put the device into flashing mode:
- **Method 1:** +
The device is not powered on. Press and hold the **DOWNLOAAO (FEL)** button, plug in the type-c, and then release the button. (If you are worried about insufficient USB power, you can first plug in the power, then release the button, and then plug in the USB cable)
- **Method 2:** +
The device is powered on. Press and hold the **DOWNLOAD (FEL)** button, then press the Reset button, and then plug in the USB cable.

+
WARNING: When connected to a USB HUB, there may be a "Fastboot device initialization failure".
+

+
If the software recognition is successful, a "**VID:PID=**" display will appear. If there are multiple devices, please select the device you want to burn.

+

. Burn completed, power on again.

== Install Image to eMMC 2
WARNING: The **Armbian** image currently only supports SD card startup.

NOTE: In addition to using titantools, you can also use the dd command to burn the image to emmc.
 
Take **bianbu-23.10-nas-k1-v1.0rc1-release-20240429192450.img**.
Unzip the "**bianbu-k1-xxx.img.zip**" to the USB drive, and then copy the "**fsbl.bin**" and "**bootinfo_emmc.bin**" in "**bianbu-k1-xxx.zip**" to copy it into the USB drive.

. Firstly, insert the SD card that has been burned into the image into F3 and power it on to start.
. Insert the copied USB drive into F3.

. After startup, use the "lsblk" command to view.
+
```sh
pi@k1:~$ lsblk
NAME        MAJ:MIN RM  SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINTS
sda           8:0    1 14.8G  0 disk
└─sda1        8:1    1 14.8G  0 part
mmcblk0     179:8    0 14.8G  0 disk
├─mmcblk0p1 179:9    0  256K  0 part
├─mmcblk0p2 179:10   0  128K  0 part
├─mmcblk0p3 179:11   0  384K  0 part
├─mmcblk0p4 179:12   0    2M  0 part
├─mmcblk0p5 179:13   0  256M  0 part
└─mmcblk0p6 179:14   0    8G  0 part /
mmcblk2     179:8    0 14.6G  0 disk
```
"sda1" refers to a USB drive, "mmcblk0" refers to an SD card, and "mmcblk2" refers to an EMMC.
. Mount the USB drive to mnt first.
+
```sh
sudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt
cd /mnt
```
. Then use the dd command to burn the image to emmc
+
```sh
sudo dd if=bianbu-23.10-nas-k1-v1.0rc1-release-20240429192450.img of=/dev/mmcblk2 bs=10M
```
NOTE: If you enter the **lsblk** command, you can see **BOOT**. You can go directly to step 9.

. Next, update the boot0 partition of EMMC. However, some image boot partitions are hidden by default, so you need to modify the cmdline. Mount bootfs:
+
```shs
sudo mount /dev/mmcblk0p5 /boot
sudo nano /boot/env_k1-x.txt
```
Find Commonargs and add "recovery=1" at the end.
+
```sh
commonargs=setenv bootargs earlycon=${earlycon} earlyprintk console=tty1 console=${console} ${loglevel} clk_ignore_unused rdinit=${init} recovery=1
```
Save and restart.
+
```sh
sudo reboot
```
. After the restart is completed, you can see the BOOT partition using the lsblk command.
+
```sh
pi@k1:~$ lsblk

mmcblk2boot0 179:16   0    4M  1 disk
mmcblk2boot1 179:24   0    4M  1 disk
```
. Mount a USB drive
+
```sh
sudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt
cd /mnt
```
. Execute the following command:
+
```sh
echo 0 | sudo tee /sys/block/mmcblk2boot0/force_ro
sudo dd if=bootinfo_emmc.bin of=/dev/mmcblk2boot0
sudo dd if=FSBL.bin of=/dev/mmcblk2boot0 seek=512 bs=1
sync
```
. After waiting for the burning to complete, disconnect the power and remove the SD card and USB drive. Power on again to start from the EMMC.
