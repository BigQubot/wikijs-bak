=== MediaTek MT7986(Filogic 830)
The MT7986(Filogic 830) integrates four Arm Cortex-A53 cores up to 2GHz with up to 18,000 DMIPs of processing power and 6Gbps of dual 4x4 Wi-Fi6 connectivity. It has two 2.5g Ethernet interfaces and serial peripheral interfaces (SPI). Filogic 830‘s built-in hardware acceleration engine enables fast and reliable Wi-Fi offloading and wireless network connection. In addition, the chip supports Mediatek FastPath™ technology, which is suitable for games, AR/VR and other low-latency applications.

Wi-fi 6 has many advantages over its predecessors, including lower latency, larger bandwidth capacity and faster transmission rates. Wireless network devices supporting the 6GHz band mainly use 160MHz wide channel and 6GHz uncongested bandwidth to provide multigigabit transmission and low-latency wi-fi connection, providing reliable wireless network for streaming media, games, AR/VR and other applications.

WARNING: Note: EMMC Boot or Nand boot Support.

== Warnning
WARNING: Note: Because BPI-R3 MINI can't support that it boot from SD, So the factory will flash one default image into Nand and EMMC Device. 
 Anytime please confirm that one EMMC or Nand device include one bootable image, it's very important!!
 
 - If you want to update EMMC device, please boot from Nand
 
image::/picture/r3mini_nandboot2.png[r3mini_nandboot2.png]
 
 - Otherwise you update Nand device when it boot from EMMC.

=== Install Image to onboard eMMC

WARNING: Note: when you want to Update EMMC device, Firstly Change boot switch to boot from Nand device, then after boot up,you need flash one emmc image into EMMC device. Finally you change bootstrap to boot from EMMC.

Before burning image to eMMC, please prepare a USB disk. Let's take OpenWrt image (mtk-bpi-r3mini-EMMC-20230719.img, bl2_emmc-r3mini.img) for example, the steps are below:

. Copy EMMC boot OpenWrt image(mtk-bpi-r3mini-EMMC-20230719.img, bl2_emmc.img) to USB disk.
. Change boot switch Jumper, the board boot from Nand device, then power up the board.
. Plug in USB disk to the board, and mount the USB to /mnt or other directory as follows: (you can skip mounting if it is mounted automatically)
+
```sh
mount -t vfat /dev/sda1 /mnt 
```
change your directory to the mounting point, here is : 
+
```sh
cd /mnt
```

. Execute following command to enable and copy image to EMMC device:
+
```sh
echo 0 > /sys/block/mmcblk0boot0/force_ro
dd if=bl2_emmc-r3mini.img of=/dev/mmcblk0boot0
dd if=mtk-bpi-r3mini-EMMC-20230719.img of=/dev/mmcblk0
mmc bootpart enable 1 1 /dev/mmcblk0
```
 . Power off R3MINI board, unplug the USB drive, and change the boot program to boot from the emmc device.
+
WARNING: Note: Enable EMMC device, boot strap is from EMMC.

=== Install Image to onboard Nand

WARNING: Note: when you want to Update Nand device, Firstly Change boot switch to boot from EMMC device, then after boot up,you need flash one nand image into nand device. Finally you change bootstrap to boot from Nand device.

Before burning image into Nand, please prepare a USB disk. Let's take OpenWrt image (mtk-bpi-r3mini-NAND-20230719-single-image.bin) for example, the steps are below:

. Copy Nand boot OpenWrt image(mtk-bpi-r3mini-NAND-20230719-single-image.bin) to USB disk.
 . Change boot switch Jumper, the board boot from EMMC device, then power up the board.
 . Plug in USB disk to the board, and mount the USB to /mnt or other directory as follows: (you can skip mounting if it is mounted automatically)
+
```sh
mount -t vfat /dev/sda1 /mnt
```
change your directory to the mounting point, here is :
+
```sh
cd /mnt
```
. Execute following command to erase the whole Nand flash and copy image to nand device:
+
```sh
mtd erase /dev/mtd0
dd if=mtk-bpi-r3mini-NAND-20230719-single-image.bin of=/dev/mtdblock0
```
. Power off BPI-R3 MINI board, remove u-disk driver, change bootstrap to boot from Nand device.
+
WARNING: Note: Enable Nand device, boot strap is from Nand.

== Advanced Development
=== GPIO Control
```sh
echo xxx > /sys/class/gpio/export
echo in/out > /sys/class/gpio/gpioxxx/direction
echo 0/1 > /sys/class/gpio/gpioxxx/value
```
Check the base gpio, you could see mine is 411



For example: if you want to change gpio 22 as out highlevel, you need input commands like this：
```sh
echo 433（22+411） > /sys/class/gpio/export
echo out > /sys/class/gpio/gpio433/direction
echo 1 > /sys/class/gpio/gpio433/value
```

=== FAN



CN16 is a 1.25 pitch 3PIN socket, used to connect the fan, supports PWM control.

=== PWM FAN Control
```sh
echo 0 > /sys/class/pwm/pwmchip0/export
echo 10000 > /sys/class/pwm/pwmchip0/pwm0/period
echo 5000 > /sys/class/pwm/pwmchip0/pwm0/duty_cycle
echo normal > /sys/class/pwm/pwmchip0/pwm0/polarity
echo 1 > /sys/class/pwm/pwmchip0/pwm0/enable
```

=== M.2 KEY B slot
Currently, M.2 KEY B slot only support USB 4G/5G module, example: Quectel RM500U-CN or RM520N-GL



when you install one 4G/5G module, you may check it.

=== 4G/5G Module
BPI-R3mini supports **M.2 KEYB USB interface** Cellular network module: 4G LTE EM05, 5G Quectel RM500U-CN/RG200U-CN and RM520N-GL/RM500Q-GL Series.

The released image(2023-09-12 or later) default driver is RM500U-CN and RM520N-GL, Install one of these two modules and you can use it directly.

If use EM05 or others,you will most likely need to modify the driver.

WARNING: Note: The availability of 4G/5G depends on the local carrier frequency band.

=== Wi-Fi Ap mode on BPI-R3mini
* ra0 is MT7986a 2.4G wifi
* rax0 is MT7986a 5G wifi

=== Serial cable
Because the UART0_TXD of the debug port is also a wifi strap pin, this pin needs to be pull-low when poweron，

some serial cable have strong pull-up, such as PL2303,if it is inserted before powering on, it will cause the wifi chip to be recognized incorrectly, and the wifi function will fail.

Other types including cp2102,ch340 and FDTI are all available, serial cable power domian must be 3.3v TTL standard.

You can buy the serial cable here: https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256805457599756.html

image::/picture/r3mini-usbc2uart.png[r3mini-usbc2uart.png]

If your computer has a USB TypeC connector and supports PD12V/1.5A (20W) or above, you can also directly use the computer to power BPI-R3mini.

Moreover, since BPI-R3mini has built-in USB to serial port chip CH340E, you do not need to use additional serial cables.

WARNING: NOTE: If your computer does not support USB PD, then the R3mini will most likely keep restarting.

Because the power consumption of R3mini is relatively large (all peripherals are plugged in and the power consumption is close to 20W when running)
