= BPI-M2+ support OV5640 camera module
Note: For BPI-M2+ , camera is not same as BPI-M2,BPI-M1.... , it support OV5640 module, not need extend board. you just can direct use OV5640 modue on CSI interface.

If you have BPI-M1/M1+/M2 camera module ,you can remove camera module from extend bard ,and can use on BPI-M2+.
