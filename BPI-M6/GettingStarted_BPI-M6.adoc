= Development
== Prepare

. Prepare a USB serial cable and a 5V/3A adaptor type-c power supply. The serial cable is used for console debugging and the type-c cable is used for Android image download.
. Prepare an SDcard of at least 8GB for Linux development, Android only supports eMMC boot.

== Android
=== Prepare

. Download and install the SenarySocSystemTool for android image download via USB type-c on M6, only support windows.
. Download the latest android image, and confirm that the md5 checksum is correct.

Download SenarySocSystemTool: link:https://download.banana-pi.dev/d/ca025d76afd448aabc63/files/?p=%2FTools%2Fimage_download_tools%2FSenarySocSystemToolSetupV1.3.2.1.rar[Download Link]

=== Install Image with Usb Burning Tool

. Open SenarySocSystemTool.exe, click Browse, and select the eMMCimg folder where the image is located.

. If you want to erase eMMC, you can repeat the above steps, but you need to click on Erase eMMC instead of starting the burn.


== Linux
=== Install Image to SD card


Install Image with Balena Etcher. +
link:https://balena.io/etcher[Balena Etcher] is an opensource GUI flash tool by Balena, Flash OS images to SDcard or USB drive.

Click on "**Flash from file**" to select image. 

Click on "**Select target**" to select USB device. 

Click on "**Flash!**" Start burning.

After the image is burned, insert the SD card into the BPI-M6. Press and hold the SPI key while inserting the power supply.

=== Install Image to eMMC
NOTE: Before burning the image to emmc, it is recommended to erase the emc first. You can link:https://docs.banana-pi.org/en/BPI-M6/GettingStarted_BPI-M6#_install_image_with_usb_burning_tool[refer to here].

. First, prepare a bootable SD card and a link:https://docs.banana-pi.org/en/BPI-M6/BananaPi_BPI-M6#_spi[new SPI file].
. Open SenarySocSystemTool and switch to Spi Flash.

. Change the path to the path where the spi file you downloaded is located.

. Press the USB button next to type-c and connect to the computer using the type-c cable.Click to start burning.

. Copy the image to a USB drive, insert it into the M6, then insert the SD card, and power on.

. Mount the USB drive.
+
```sh
mount /dev/sda1 /mnt
cd /mnt
```

. Then use the dd command to burn the image to emmc
+
```sh
dd if=Armbian-bpi-senarytech-trunk_Bananapim6-xxx.img of=/dev/mmcblk0
```

. Wait for the burning to complete. Turn off the power, remove the SD card (if an SD card is inserted, the SD card will be started first), and then turn on the power while holding down the SPI key. Then the eMMC can be started.

== HDMI
VS680 HDMI TX functional properties:

- Support hdmi v2.1
- Support up to 2160p@60 YUV444
- Support up to 1080p@60 with 12b deep color
- Support up to HDCP 2.2
- Support HBR output
- Support HDR10 and HLG

=== HDMI TX software configuration
VS680 currently uses two display frameworks, FB and DRM

Source code file for FB scheme: +
**syna-release/linux_5_4/drivers/video/syna/source/**

Source code file for DBM scheme: +
**syna-release/linux_5_4/drivers/soc/berlin/modules/drm/**

Enable the HDMI TX feature in the configuration file. The configuration file is located in the SDK's **syna-release/configs/product/vs680_a0_android_baseline_evk/vs680_a0_android_baseline_evk_defconfig**，with the following configuration:

image::/picture/bpi-m6_hdmi_tx_software_configuration.png[bpi-m6_hdmi_tx_software_configuration.png]

=== Enable HDCP
```sh
test_disp enable/disable hdcp
test_disp setVersion 1 //set hdcp 1.4
test_disp setVersion 2 //set hdcp 2.2
```

=== Resolution Configuration
Supported standards: CEA-861-E video format

Supported resolutions: +
**3840x2160p60Hz/30Hz//24Hz** +
**1920x1200@60hz** +
**1920x1080p@60** +
**1280x700p@60**
	
Configure resolution and format on the command line:

test_disp setformat[Display ID] [Resolution ID] [BitDepth] [Color fmt] [Aspect Ratio][tgID][vout_mode]

Examples:
```sh
test_disp setformat 0 64 2 0
```


== GPIO

=== PWM

The BPI-M6 has three PWM pins, and their corresponding GPIOs are GPIO53, GPIO36 and GPIO37.

image::/bpi-m6/bpi-m6_pwm1.jpg[bpi-m6_pwm1.jpg]

You can use the following command to enable it.

```sh
echo 1 |sudo tee /sys/class/pwm/pwmchip0/export
```

Then you can use this command to check if the pwm is enabled.

```sh
ls /sys/class/pwm/pwmchip0
```

For example:
