= The development of preparation
- First, ensure the integrity of the current firmware dependency package
+
```sh
help(“modules”)
```
- The effect is shown below. If you do not have two dependency packages on the diagram, please burn the latest firmware.

Make sure you're connected to the Internet. if not , please see link:/en/BPI-Bit/Bit_for_MicroPython/WiFI_wireless_connection[2 WiFI wireless connection]

= Prepare the weather API

. I'm using the national weather service API here, http://www.weather.com.cn/data/cityinfo/101200801.html # 101200801 （In jingzhou city），See details of city ids： http://mobile.weather.com.cn/js/citylist.xml

. Request to return Json data sample
+
```sh
{
"weatherinfo": 
{
"city": "jingzhou",
"cityid": "101200801",
"img1": "n7.gif",
"img2": "d2.gif",
"ptime": "18:00",
"temp1": "16℃",
"temp2": "23℃",
"weather": "Rain turns shade"
}
}
```
We can analyze these json files and write an example like this

== Example analyse
```sh
import urequests
from microbit import * 

def get_weather():
	url = "http://www.weather.com.cn/data/cityinfo/101200801.html"
	rsp = urequests.get(url)
	data = eval(rsp.text) # eval function is used to convert string type json data from -> to python dictionary type
	weather = data["weatherinfo"]
	L = weather["temp1"] #lowest temperature
	H = weather["temp2"] #the highest temperature
	return "L:" + L[:-1] + " H:" + H[:-1] #Data sample->  L:16 H:23

display.scroll(get_weather())

# L[:-1] H[:-1]Remove ℃ ℉ and two special symbol, can appear otherwise coding errors
```
= Write at end
These operations are all performed in mpfshell. If you use Pycharm programming, you can also operate in mpfshell tools. I believe you should all be able to operate.
