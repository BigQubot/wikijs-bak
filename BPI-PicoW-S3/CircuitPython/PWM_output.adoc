. The brightness of the LED light can be controlled by controlling the PWM duty cycle. The control duty cycle is from 0% to 100%, using 16-bit precision, 0 to 65535 in decimal and 0 to FFFF in hexadecimal. Enter the following code in the REPL:
+
```py
import board
import pwmio
ledpin = pwmio.PWMOut(board.LED, frequency=25000, duty_cycle=0)
ledpin.duty_cycle = 32768  # mid-point 0-65535 = 50 % duty-cycle
```
. Just enter the last line of code again in the REPL to change the PWM duty cycle to bring the LED to maximum brightness:
+
```py
ledpin.duty_cycle = 65535
```
. Use `while` and `for` loops to make breathing lights:
+
```py
import board
import pwmio
import time

ledpin = pwmio.PWMOut(board.LED, frequency=25000, duty_cycle=0)

while True:
    for i in range(0, 65535, 1):
        ledpin.duty_cycle = i
    for i in range(65535, 0, -1):
        ledpin.duty_cycle = i
```
