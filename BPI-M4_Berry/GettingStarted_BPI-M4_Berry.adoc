=== Prepare

. Linux image support SDcard or EMMC bootup, but you should read the [Boot_Sequence boot sequence] at first.

. It’s recommended to use A1 rated cards, 8GB at least.

. Make sure bootable EMMC is formatted if you want bootup from SDcard.

. Make sure SDcard is formatted without Linux image flashed if you want bootup from EMMC and use Sdcard as storage.

. Download latest Linux Linux Image, and confirm that the md5 checksum is correct.

. Default login: pi/bananapi or root/bananapi

. The wiki guide is only for ubuntu/debian images.

=== Install Image to SDcard

. Install Image with Balena Etcher on Windows, Linux and MacOS.

. Install Image with Balena Cli on Windows, Linux and MacOS.
+
link:https://github.com/balena-io/balena-cli [Balena CLI] is a Command Line Interface for balenaCloud or openBalena. It can be used to flash linux image.
+
Download the installer or standalone package from link:https://github.com/balena-io/balena-cli/releases[balena-io] and link:https://github.com/balena-io/balena-cli/blob/master/INSTALL.md[install] it correctly to your PC, then you can use the link:https://docs.balena.io/reference/balena-cli/#local-flash-image[local flash] command option of balena to flash a linux image to sdcard or usb drive.
+
```bash
sudo balena local flash path/to/xxx-bpi-m4-berry-xxx.img.zip
sudo balena local flash path/to/xxx-bpi-m4-berry-xxx.img.zip --drive /dev/disk2
sudo balena local flash path/to/xxx-bpi-m4-berry-xxx.img.zip --drive /dev/disk2 --yes
```

. Install Image with dd command on Linux, umount SDcard device /dev/sdX partition if mounted automatically. Actually bpi-copy is the same as this dd command.
+
```sh
sudo apt-get install pv unzip
sudo unzip -p xxx-bpi-m4-berry-xxx.img.zip | pv | dd of=/dev/sdX bs=10M status=noxfer
```

. Install image with bpi-tools on Linux, plug SDcard to Linux PC and run
+
```sh
sudo apt-get install pv unzip
sudo bpi-copy xxx-bpi-m4-berry-xxx.img.zip /dev/sdX
