+
You can also judge by the light. When the red light changes from normally on to off, the burning is complete.
+

.  After the burning is completed, the power will be cut off, and the SD card will be removed. Power on again to start from eMMC.

== Linux
=== Prepare
. Linux image support SDcard or EMMC bootup
. It’s recommended to use A1 rated cards, 8GB at least.
. Install bpi-tools on your Linux PC(if flash image with other tools, ignore this step). If you can't access this URL or any other install problem, please go to link:https://github.com/bpi-sinovoip/bpi-tools[bpi-tools] source repo, download and install this tools manually.
+
```sh
 $ apt-get install pv
 $ curl -sL https://github.com/BPI-SINOVOIP/bpi-tools/raw/master/bpi-tools | sudo -E bash
```
. Download latest Linux Image, and confirm that the md5 checksum is correct.
. Default login: pi/bananapi or root/bananapi

=== Install Image to SDcard
**Windows PC**

Install Image with Balena Etcher. +
link:https://balena.io/etcher[Balena Etcher] is an opensource GUI flash tool by Balena, Flash OS images to SDcard or USB drive.

. Click on "**Flash from file**" to select image. 
. Click on "**Select target**" to select USB device. 
. Click on "**Flash!**" Start burning.

image::/picture/etcher.jpg[etcher.jpg]

**Linux PC**

**There are two methods for you to choose from.**

. Install Image with dd command on Linux, umount SDcard device /dev/sdX partition if mounted automatically. Actually bpi-copy is the same as this dd command.
+
```sh
 $ sudo apt-get install pv unzip
 $ sudo unzip -p xxx-bpi-p2_zero-xxx.img.zip | pv | dd of=/dev/sdX bs=10M status=noxfer
```
. Install image with bpi-tools on Linux, plug SDcard to Linux PC and run
+
```sh
 $ sudo apt-get install pv unzip
 $ sudo bpi-copy xxx-bpi-p2_zero-xxx.img.zip /dev/sdX
```

=== Install Image to eMMC

. Prepare a SDcard with Linux image flashed and bootup board with this SDcard.
. Unzip the image and copy it to a USB drive, plug the udisk to board and mount it.（If automatically mounted, ignore this step）
+
```sh
mount /dev/sdx /mnt
```
. There are two ways to install the linux image to board.

IMPORTANT: Please check that your EMMC partition is mmcblk0, the following is just an example of use, focusing on the actual partition.

- Install with dd command.
+
```sh
sudo dd if=/mnt/xxx.bpi-p2_zero-xxx.img of=/dev/mmcblk0 bs=10M status=noxfer
```
- Install the linux image in udisk with bpi-tools command
+
```sh
 $ sudo bpi-copy xxx-bpi-p2_zero-xxx.img.zip /dev/mmcblk0
```
. After download complete, power off safely and eject the SDcard.

=== Update your image
. Get the p2 zero bsp source code
+
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/BPI-SINOVOIP/BPI-M2P-bsp-4.4
```

. Build the source code according to the README.md, and update the packages to the sdcard with bpi image flashed.

== Advanced Development
=== How to create an image
- Prepare a SD card which have installed system(Ubuntu/Raspbian/..)
- Boot your SD card with M2 Zero, after M2 Zero finish starting, copy your files and config your system, then poweroff M2 Zero. [If you don't want to config your system, you can skip this step]
- Plug your SD card in PC(which is running Linux)
+
```sh
cd /media
ln -s <your account> pi
```
- Execute 
+
```sh
bpi-migrate -c bpi-m2z.conf -c ubuntu-mate-from-sd.conf -d /dev/sdx
```
- Then you could get your own image now

=== OTG
. On M2 Zero console:
+
Execute 
+
```sh
./adbd.sh
ps -ax | grep adbd
```
see if adbd is set up

. On PC terminal:
+
--
If adbd was succeed to set up, insert OTG-USB interface to M2 Zero and PC(with Ubuntu system)

Execute 
```sh
adb devices
```
see if PC has recognised M2 ZeroP OTG.

If yes, we could execute
```sh
adb shel
```
connect M2 Zero by adb now
--

=== EMac
Use iperf3 to test network



=== Bluetooth
- Use bluetoothctl tool to operate BT
- Execute
+
```sh
bluetoothctl
```
- If you don't know how to use bluetoothctl, type "**help**", you will see more commands
- Execute these commands:



=== WiFi Client
**You have two ways to setup WiFi Client**

. Use commands to setup WiFi client
+
--
```sh
ip link set wlan0 up
iw dev wlan0 scan | grep SSID
vim /etc/wpasupplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf
```
```sh
 network={    
 ssid="ssid"    
 psk="password"    
 priority=1 
 }
```
```sh
wpa_supplicant -iwlan0 -c /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf
dhclient wlan0
```
--

. Use UI interface to setup WiFi Client

=== Clear boot
```sh
git clone https://github.com/BPI-SINOVOIP/BPI-files/tree/master/SD/100MB
bpi-bootsel BPI-cleanboot-8k.img.gz /dev/sdX
```
=== Camara function
We use HDF5640 camara.

image::/picture/ov5640_camara.png[ov5640_camara.png]

**Guvcview**

Use your UI interface to operate camara

Applications -> Sound & Video -> guvcview

**Shell**

- We also have built-in command in **/usr/local/bin** to test camara
- Test picture taking function
+
```sh
./test_ov5640_image_mode.sh
```
- Test video recording function
+
```sh
./cameratest.sh
```

=== Display
How to change display resolution
For Example： we change M2Z HDMI display 1080P.

. Execute
+
```sh
mount /dev/mmcblk0p1 /mnt
cd /mnt/bananapi/bpi-m2z/linux
```
find "**sys_config.fex**"

. Execute
+
```sh
vim sys_config.fex
```
change
+
```sh
screen0_output_mode = 5
```
to 
+
```sh
screen0_output_mode = 10
```
+
image::/picture/display_output.png[display_output.png]

. After save changed, use
+
```sh
fex2bin
```
command to transfer sys_config.fex to bin file, "**fex2bin sys_config.fex script.bin** ", reboot.
+
parameters meaning：
