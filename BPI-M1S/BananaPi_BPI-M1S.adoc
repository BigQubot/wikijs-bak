= Overview

Banana Pi BPI-M1 Super utilizes the Rockchip RK3528, a new-generation intelligent set-top box and multimedia application chip. It is applicable to IPTV/OTT boxes, cloud terminals, and integrated products. It is a high-performance, low-power 4K player with decoding capability supporting up to 8K. Additionally, it also supports the AVS2 and HDR VIVID standards.
