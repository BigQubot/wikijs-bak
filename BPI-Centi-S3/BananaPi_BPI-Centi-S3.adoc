= BPI-Centi-S3 Introduction

BPI-Centi-S3 is a small-sized ESP32-S3 development board with an
1.9-inch LCD onboard, suitable for the development of Internet of Things
application projects including color display, interactive control,
wireless communication, and sensor data acquisition.

Using the Espressif ESP32-S3 chip, it supports 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi and
Bluetooth® Low Energy (Bluetooth® LE) dual-mode wireless communication.

Within the compact board, it also provides an additional rotary encoder,
a buzzer, a WS2812 color LED, and all other available pins for external
peripherals connection to meet diverse needs.

Support both USB and external 3.7V lithium battery power input. With the
board’s designed battery voltage detection circuit, it can automatically
detect and switch to USB power supply when both are connected. And also
supports USB charging mode, convenient for power management.
