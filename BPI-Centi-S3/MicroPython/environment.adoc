== System Environment Requirements

Supports development in Windows 10, Windows 11, MacOS, Ubuntu or other
Linux desktop operating systems.

All the application examples in this article are based on the Windows 10
operating system, and other operating systems can also be used for
reference.

== Install the Python environment

Open https://www.python.org/[Python official website].

For the Windows system, the most convenient way to download the
installation package is to click the icon shown in the figure below on
the homepage of the official website to download.

Other operating systems or other distributions can be selected in the
Downloads option bar.

It is recommended to use a version above python 3.7.

Be sure to check Add Python 3.x to PATH when you start the installation,
so that you can avoid adding it to PATH manually.

Follow the installation prompts step by step to complete the
installation smoothly.

== Install the mpremote tool

The MicroPython open source community has launched a development aid
tool: mpremote, through which we can establish serial communication with
the development board, use REPL, and manage the file system on the
development board. It also has mount and mip functions, which will be
described in detail in subsequent chapters (preparing).

After installing the Python environment, you can use pip to install
mpremote in the terminal.

Open PowerShell in the Windows system, and open the corresponding
terminal in other operating systems, and enter the following command to
install mpremote.

....
pip install mpremote
....

== Install the mpbridge tool

mpbridge is a CLI tool developed based on mpremote. It mainly provides
the function of automatically synchronizing files to improve development
efficiency.

Enter the following command in Terminal to install mpbridge.

....
pip install mpbridge
....

== Install Visual Studio Code

The use of MicroPython does not depend on specific development tools, as
long as the serial port communication with the development board can be
established, the MicroPython interactive interpreter (REPL) can be
obtained.

Purely speaking, we basically only need a text editor to edit the code,
and then upload our .py script files or other files to the development
board through the mpremote tool or mpbridge tool.

For a specific editor that combines basic code completion, syntax
highlighting, integrated terminal, and lightweight, multi-platform
adaptation requirements, I recommend using Visual Studio Code (VScode),
which may already be the tool you are most familiar with one of them.

All in Web people, minimalists, try https://vscode.dev/[VScode on the
Web], open a terminal on the local operating system and use mpremote or
mpbridge to synchronize files, MicroPython REPL.

== Other recommended editors

* https://github.com/thonny/thonny/releases[Thonny], an open source
graphical python editor sponsored by the Raspberry Pi Foundation,
factory integrated with Raspberry Pi OS (Raspbian), the first choice for
Raspberry Pi users to get started .
* https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=windows[PyCharm
Community Edition], the free community edition is sufficient, and it
also has code completion for micropython special libraries, although
incomplete and It hasnâ€™t been updated for a long time.
* https://jupyter.org/[Jupyter] is also an editor on the web side, more
professional, more pythonic, and supports web terminals.
