== Install Image to eMMC 1

NOTE: Please prepare an SD card with the image burned.And a USB drive containing image.

. Insert the SD card into M7, connect the power and start it. Insert the USB drive.

. Execute
+
```sh
lsblk
```
to check if the USB drive is mounted. (If already mounted, you can skip step three))

. Mount the USB drive to mnt.
+
```sh
sudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt
cd /mnt
```

. Execute
+
```sh
sudo dd if=bpi-m7-xxx.img of=/dev/mmcblk0 bs=10M
```


. Disconnect the power and remove the SD card. Power on again and start up from the EMMC.

== Install Image to eMMC 2
NOTE: Maskrom: When Flash is not burning firmware, the chip will boot into Maskrom mode, which can be burned for the first time. During the development and debugging process, if the Loader fails to start normally, you can also enter the Maskrom mode to burn firmware.     

NOTE: Loader: The principle is that during the uboot startup, the pin is detected to be pressed. In Loader mode, the firmware can be burned and upgraded. You can burn a partition image file separately through the tool to facilitate debugging.

=== Debian

NOTE: Please prepare Type-C wire for mirror burning.

We open the RKDevTool burning tool (RKDevTool burning tool is included in the Android usage tutorial) and set the product to burn mode.

== Fan
The BPI-M7 features a 5V fan using a 0.8mm connector

Currently, the fan has five default states:

|====
|Temperature State |PWM |Speed
|>50°	|0	|0
|50°-55°	|1	|50
|55°-60°	|2	|100
|60°-65°	|3	|150
|65°-70°	|4	|200
|70°<	|5	|250
|====


```sh 
# Check the current speed
cat /sys/class/hwmon/hwmon9/pwm1 
```
== Type-C
The BPI-M7 features a full-featured USB Type‐C 3.1 port which supports up to 4Kp60 DP display.

== 40Pin
The BPI-M7 provides a 40-pin GPIO header, compatible with most sensors on the market.

== RGB LED
The BPI-M7 has two user LEDs - green and red.

* User Green LED,Constantly indicates running kernel by default.
* User Red LED Off by default, can be controlled by user.

Users can control with commands:
```sh 
armsom@armsom-sige7:/# sudo su  
armsom@armsom-sige7:/# echo timer > /sys/class/leds/red/trigger  
armsom@armsom-sige7:/# echo activity > /sys/class/leds/red/trigger
```
== RTC
* The BPI-M7 features an hym8563 RTC chip.
* First, insert the RTC battery using the 2-pin header to supply power to the RTC IC.
* Note that we should keep the RTC battery in the RTC connector and confirm the rtc hym8563 device which has been created.
+
```sh 
armsom@armsom-sige7:/# dmesg | grep rtc  
[ 6.407133] rtc-hym8563 6-0051: rtc information is valid  
[ 6.412731] rtc-hym8563 6-0051: registered as rtc0  
[ 6.413779] rtc-hym8563 6-0051: setting system clock to 2022-06-22T01:22:26 UTC (1655860946)  
```
* Find rtc0, then use the following commands to set system time and sync to rtc0:
+
```sh 
armsom@armsom-sige7:/# hwclock -r  
2023-11-03 10:32:40.461910+00:00  
armsom@armsom-sige7:/# date

armsom@armsom-sige7:/# hwclock -w  
armsom@armsom-sige7:/# hwclock -r  
armsom@armsom-sige7:/# poweroff  
```
* Turn off the RTC battery for 10+ minutes, insert the battery again and boot Sige7, and check if RTC synced with system clock:
+
```sh 
armsom@armsom-sige7:/# hwclock -r  
2023-11-03 10:35:40.461910+00:00  
armsom@armsom-sige7:/# date
Fri 3rd Nov 10:36:01 UTC 2023
```

== M.2
The BPI-M7 provides an M.2 connector:

* There is an M.2 M Key connector on the back with a 4-lane PCIe 3.0 interface. The board has a standard M.2 2280 mounting hole to deploy M.2 2280 NVMe SSDs.
+
WARNING: Note: This M.2 interface does NOT support M.2 SATA SSDs.
+
```sh 
armsom@armsom-sige7:/# mkdir temp  
armsom@armsom-sige7:/# mount /dev/nvme0n1 temp
```

== Camera
**MIPI-CSI**

Use the camera-module for the camera. After connecting and powering on the camera module you can view the boot log:
```sh

== MIPI DSI
The BPI-M7 supports up to 4K@60Hz resolution over MIPI DSI

== CAN Usage

=== CAN Introduction

CAN (Controller Area Network): A serial communication network that effectively supports distributed control or real-time control.

Currently, most automobile manufacturers in the world adopt the CAN bus to achieve data communication between internal control systems of automobiles.

RK3568/RK3588 CAN driver file: drivers/net/can/rockchip/rockchip_canfd.c

In the BPI-M7, CAN is integrated into the 40PIN, which can be reused by users as CAN-related pins.

=== Schematic Diagram

Location of CAN in 40PIN: CAN_TX corresponds to pin 35 in 40PIN, and CAN_RX corresponds to pin 12 in 40PIN.

image::/bpi-m7/bpi-m7_canbus_sch.png[bpi-m7_canbus_sch.png]

=== Hardware Connection

CAN module wiring: CAN_TX connects to CAN_TX, CAN_RX connects to CAN_RX.

image::/bpi-m7/bpi-m7_canbus_pin.png[bpi-m7_canbus_pin.png]

=== Kernel Configuration

* rockchip_linux_defconfig configuration:

```sh 
CONFIG_CAN=y
CONFIG_CAN_DEV=y
CONFIG_CAN_ROCKCHIP=y
CONFIG_CANFD_ROCKCHIP=y
```

* Kernel configuration:

```sh 
cd kernel
make ARCH=arm64 menuconfig
make savedefconfig

```
* Select: Networking support ---> CAN bus subsystem support ()--->CAN Device Drivers() ---> Platform CAN drivers with Netlink support(*)

image::/bpi-m7/bpi-m7_canbus_control.png[bpi-m7_canbus_control.png]

===  DTS Node Configuration

* 1 Main Parameters:

** interrupts Generates an interrupt signal upon completion of transfer.

** clock Clock attribute, used to turn on/off clk; reset attribute, used to reset the bus each time.

** pinctrl Configures CAN-related pin information and function multiplexing.

** compatible = "rockchip,can-1.0" is used to match the can controller driver.

** compatible = "rockchip,can-2.0" is used to match the canfd controller driver.

** assigned-clock-rates is used to configure the constant frequency of the can. If the CAN bit rate is less than or equal to 3M, it is recommended to modify the CAN clock to 100M for more stable signals. For bit rates higher than 3M, a clock setting of 200M is sufficient.

** pinctrl configuration: Based on the actual board connection, configure the iomux of can_h and can_l for the can function.

* 3 Board-level Configuration

kernel-5.10/arch/arm64/boot/dts/rockchip/rk3588-armsom-w3.dts

```sh 
/* can1 */
&can1 {
        status = "okay";
        assigned-clocks = <&cru CLK_CAN1>;
        assigned-clock-rates = <200000000>;
        pinctrl-names = "default";
        pinctrl-0 = <&can1m1_pins>;      #Configure based on the schematic diagram
};
```

Since the CAN device created by the system according to the above dts node is only one, and the first created device is CAN0.

=== CAN Communication Test

Query current network devices:

```sh
ifconfig -a
```

CAN startup

```sh
