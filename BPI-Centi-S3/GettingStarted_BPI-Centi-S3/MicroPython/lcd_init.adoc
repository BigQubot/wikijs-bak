There is a 1.9-inch TFT LCD color screen on the front of BPI-Centi-S3 with a resolution of 170*320. The driver chip is ST7789V3, which is connected to the ESP32S3 chip through an 8-bit parallel interface.

The ST7789 C module driver has been integrated in the factory firmware, from:

Thanks to russhughes for the open source, you can check the compilation method and all API interfaces in his GitHub README.

## Initialize, light up the screen

Create a main.py in the local folder, copy the code below into it, and save the file.

> Use the `ctrl + S` shortcut to save the file in the current window.

```py
""" BPI-Centi-S3 170x320 ST7789 display """

import st7789
from machine import freq


def config(rotation=0, options=0):

     return st7789.ST7789(
         170,
         320,
         15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8,
         wr=6,
         rd=7,
         reset=3,
         dc=5,
         cs=4,
         backlight=2,
         power=2,
         rotation=rotation,
         options=options)


freq(240_000_000) # Set esp32s3 cpu frequency to 240MHz
tft = config(rotation=1, options=0)
tft.init() # Initialize
tft.fill(st7789.RED)
tft. show(True)
tft.deinit() # Deinitialize the display or it will cause a crash on the next run

```

Use mpbridge to synchronize files to the development board.

When the synchronization is complete, the BPI-Centi-S3 screen will be full-screen red.

## Separate configuration files

We can place the code for initializing and configuring ST7789 in a python script file, and then import and use it anywhere else, including in the REPL, which can enhance code reusability.

Create a separate configuration file tft_config.py , copy the code below into it, and save the file.

```py
""" BPI-Centi-S3 170x320 ST7789 display """

import st7789
from machine import freq


def config(rotation=0, options=0):

     return st7789.ST7789(
         170,
         320,
         15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8,
         wr=6,
         rd=7,
         reset=3,
         dc=5,
         cs=4,
         backlight=2,
         power=2,
         rotation=rotation,
         options=options)

freq(240_000_000) # Set esp32s3 cpu frequency to 240MHz

```

Modify main.py to the following code:

```py
""" BPI-Centi-S3 170x320 ST7789 display """

import st7789
import tft_config

tft = tft_config.config(rotation=1, options=0)
tft.init()
tft.fill(st7789.RED)
tft. show(True)
tft.deinit() # Deinitialize the display or it will cause a crash on the next run

```

Use mpbridge to synchronize files to the development board.

Later we can simply import and initialize the screen like this.
