== Prepare

. Linux image support SDcard or EMMC bootup.
. It’s recommended to use A1 rated cards, 16GB at least.
. Make sure bootable EMMC is formatted if you want bootup from SDcard Yocto
. Download latest Linux Image, and confirm that the checksum is correct.
. Default login: pi/bananapi or root/bananapi

== Install Image to SDcard

> Install Image with Balena Etcher on Windows, Linux and MacOS.

link:https://balena.io/etcher[Balena Etcher] is an opensource GUI flash tool by Balena, Flash OS images to SDcard or USB drive.

- Click on "**Flash from file**" to select image. 
- Click on "**Select target**" to select USB device. 
- Click on "**Flash!**" Start burning.

> Install Image with Balena Cli on Windows, Linux and MacOS.

link:https://github.com/balena-io/balena-cli[Balena CLI] is a Command Line Interface for balenaCloud or openBalena. It can be used to flash linux image. Download the installer or standalone package from link:https://github.com/balena-io/balena-cli/releases[balena-io] and link:https://github.com/balena-io/balena-cli/blob/master/INSTALL.md[install ]it correctly to your PC, then you can use the "link:https://docs.balena.io/reference/balena-cli/#local-flash-image[local flash]" command option of balena to flash a linux image to sdcard or usb drive.

```sh
  $ sudo balena local flash xxx-bpi-ai2n-xxx.img.xz
  $ sudo balena local flash xxx-bpi-ai2n-xxx.img.xz --drive /dev/disk2
  $ sudo balena local flash xxx-bpi-ai2n-xxx.img.xz --drive /dev/disk2 --yes
```

> Install Image with dd command on Linux

umount SDcard device /dev/sdX partition if mounted automatically. 

```sh
 $ sudo apt-get install xz-utils pv
 $ sudo sh -c 'xzcat xxx-bpi-ai2n-xxx.img.xz | pv | dd of=/dev/sdX bs=1M status=progress && sync'
```

== Install Image to eMMC

. Prepare a SDcard with Linux image flashed and bootup board with this SDcard.
. Copy Linux image to udisk, plug the udisk to board and mount it.
. Install with dd command, umount mmcblk0p1 and mmcblk0p2 partition if mounted automatically. 
+
```sh
 $ sudo apt-get install xz-utils pv
 $ sudo sh -c 'xzcat xxx-bpi-ai2n-xxx.img.xz | pv | dd of=/dev/sdX bs=1M status=progress && sync'
```

. another way is transfer the live running Armbian system from an SD card to internal storage devices such as eMMC. It prepares the target storage, copies the active system, adjusts bootloader settings, and ensures the system can boot independently without requiring reinstallation.
+
```sh
 $ sudo armbian-config --cmd STO001
```

== Build Linux Source Code
Get source code

```sh
 $ git clone 
```
Build source code

```sh
 $  
```

== Armbian-Config

link:https://docs.armbian.com/User-Guide_Armbian-Config/[Armbian-Config] is a utility for configuring your board, adjusting services, and installing applications. It comes with Armbian  images by default.

To start the Armbian configuration utility, use the following command:

```sh
 $ sudo armbian-config
```

== Debug Serial

The board has two debug serial interfaces:

. Type-C interface. Can be connected to a PC using a regular USB Type-C cable without Linux or Windows specific driver install.

. Three pin header interface. A standard 3.3V TTL-level UART port, requires a USB to TTL serial cable (such as CP2102, PL2303, CH340, etc.) to connect to the PC.

image::/picture/ai2n-debug-uart.png[ai2n-debug-uart.png]

=== Networking

All standard Linux network configuration methods are applicable to the board, such as NetworkManager, Netplan, etc. You can also use **armbian-config** to configure all network interfaces.

```sh
 $ sudo armbian-config --cmd BNS001
```
image::/picture/ai2n-network.png[ai2n-network.png]

== Display

== RGB LED
The board has two RGB LEDs for user control

. Yellow LED on carrier board, default state is heatbeat trigger
+
```sh
 $ sudo sh -c 'echo timer > /sys/class/leds/carrier-led/trigger'
```
. Blue LED on core board, default state is default-on trigger
+
```sh
 $ sudo sh -c 'echo none > /sys/class/leds/core-led/trigger'
```

== Fan

Enable fan

```sh
 $ sudo sh -c 'echo 1 > /sys/class/hwmon/hwmon3/fan1_target'
```

Disable fan

```sh
 $ sudo sh -c 'echo 0 > /sys/class/hwmon/hwmon3/fan1_target'
```

== M.2 NVME
The board has a PCIe ×2 m.2 M-key connector (Pcie 3.0), and standard M.2 2280 mounting hole, allowing for the deployment of an M.2 2280 NVMe SSD.

```sh
 $ lspci

Configure overlays with GUI tool armbian-config.

```sh
 $ sudo armbian-config --cmd DTO001
```

image::/picture/ai2n_overlay.png[ai2n_overlay.png]

Alternatively, add names of overlays you want to activate to **overlays=** line in **/boot/armbianEnv.txt**, separated with spaces. For example, enable i2c2, spi2 and uart0 overlays

```sh
 overlays=i2c1 spi2 uart0
```

Reboot the board to apply overlays configuration


== Gpiod
Traditionally GPIO pins are exposed by Linux kernel under /sys/class/gpio namespace. However, this interface has been deprecated since version 4.8. The replacement is a C binding called link:https://libgpiod.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html[libgpiod], along with a set of user land tools called gpiod.

. Install Gpiod
+
```sh
 $ sudo apt install gpiod
```

. List GPIO chips
+
print their labels and number of GPIO lines. Chips may be identified by number, name, or path. e.g. ‘0’, ‘gpiochip0’, and ‘/dev/gpiochip0’ all refer to the same chip.
+
```sh
 $ sudo gpiodetect
 gpiochip0 [10410000.pinctrl] (96 lines)
```

. List GPIO lines
+
Print information about GPIO lines. Lines are specified by name, or optionally by offset if the chip option is provided. Each line corresponds to a GPIO pin, and the GPIO number of each pin is the line number plus 416.

+
```sh
 $ sudo gpioinfo
	gpiochip0 - 96 lines:
	        line   0:       "P0_0"    "sys-led"  output  active-high [used]
	        line   1:       "P0_1"       unused   input  active-high 
	        line   2:       "P0_2"       unused   input  active-high 
	        line   3:       "P0_3"       unused   input  active-high
           ...
	        line  93:       "PB_5"       unused   input  active-high 
	        line  94:       "PB_6"       unused   input  active-high 
	        line  95:       "PB_7"       unused   input  active-high
```

. Get gpio line number from name, For example, 40pin header phy pin.31 name is P9_5.
+
```sh
 $ sudo gpiofind P9_5
 77
```

. Read value of 40pin header phy pin.31
+
```sh
 $ sudo gpioget gpiochip0 77
 1
```

. Set value of 40pin header phy pin.31 to low
+
```sh
 $ sudo gpioset gpiochip0 77=0
```

. Monitor GPIO level change event, You need to specify either -r for rising edge events or -f for falling edge events, but not both.
+
```sh
 $ sudo gpiomon -r gpiochip0 77
 event:  RISING EDGE offset: 77 timestamp: [   22813.801682561]
```

=== Python3-gpiod
link:https://pypi.org/project/gpiod/0.6.0/[python3-gpiod] is the Python binding for the libgpiod library, which allows users to control GPIO lines using Python,
 
=== Python3-periphery
link:https://python-periphery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/[python-periphery] is a pure Python library for GPIO, LED, PWM, SPI, I2C, MMIO, and Serial peripheral I/O interface access in userspace Linux, For 40pin header bus control, dtb overlay must be enabled before using.

=== Adafruit-Blinka

link:https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Blinka[Adafruit Blinka] is a compatibility layer that brings the CircuitPython hardware API on Linux OS using Python3, making it easy to use sensors, displays, and other I2C/SPI/UART devices.

== WiringPi
WARNING: Note: This WiringPi only support set 40pin gpio to output, input, for io functions as i2c, spi, pwm..., you must enable dtb overlays

Build and install wiringPi, for debian, you must install sudo before build

```sh
 $ sudo apt-get update
 $ sudo apt-get install build-essential git
 $ git clone https://github.com/Dangku/WiringPi
 $ cd WiringPi
 $ chmod a+x build
 $ sudo ./build
```
Run gpio readall to show all 40pins status.
```sh
 $ sudo gpio readall

 Status: Downloaded newer image for hello-world:latest
 
 Hello from Docker!
 This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.
 
 To generate this message, Docker took the following steps:
  1. The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon.
  2. The Docker daemon pulled the "hello-world" image from the Docker Hub.
     (arm64v8)
  3. The Docker daemon created a new container from that image which runs the
     executable that produces the output you are currently reading.
  4. The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent it
     to your terminal.
 
 To try something more ambitious, you can run an Ubuntu container with:
  $ docker run -it ubuntu bash
