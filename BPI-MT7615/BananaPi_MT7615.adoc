== About MTK MT7615 chip
MT7615 is a highly integrated Wi-Fi single chip which support 1733 Mbps PHY rate,It fully compies with IEEE 802.11ac and IEEE802.11 a/b/n standards,offering feature-rich wireless connecivity at high standards,and delivering reliable,cost-effective throughput from and extended distance.

Optimized RF architectue and baseband algorithms provide superb performance and low power consumption. Intelligent MAC design deploys a high efficient offload engine ,and hardware data processing accelerators which completely offloads Wi-Fi task of the host processor.MT7615 is designed to support standard based features in the areas of the host processor.MT7615 is designed to support standard based features in the areas of security quality of service and international regulations.giving end users the greatest performance any time and in any circumstance.

MT7615 supports concurrent dual-band operation at 5GHz and 2.4GHz band(DBDC,Dual-Band-Dual-Concurrent0.It enables diversified applications that require one link at 2.4GHz band,and the other at less crowded 5GHz band simultaneously.

With the advent of 802.11ac,multiuser MIMO(MU-MIMO) is defined. Mt7615 supports MU-MIMO with defferent configurations.An AP is able to use its antenna drrays to transmit multiple frames to defferent clients at the same time and over the same frequency spectrum.
