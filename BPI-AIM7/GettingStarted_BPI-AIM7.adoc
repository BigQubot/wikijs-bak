= System Image Burning

The AIM development kit supports multiple system images, and you can choose the appropriate image to download according to your needs.

NOTE: A system image includes the Linux kernel, basic programs, etc., which are essential for running the AIM development kit, so you need to install the image before running the product.

== Obtaining the System Image

Visit the Baidu Cloud resource page to obtain the system image: 

Baidu Cloud Link: https://pan.baidu.com/share/init?surl=4qfAZM3QqgJPuFVjKRSBUw&pwd=arms

NOTE: 1,The default account/password for the official image is armsom/armsom, linaro/linaro, root/1234. +
2,The Debian system is adapted and compiled using the SDK provided by RK, making it more suitable for users with ISP, GPU, codec, and NPU needs. It can be burned to eMMC using RKDevTool or to an SD card using SDDiskTool. +
3,Ubuntu, Armbian, and OpenWrt are additional options provided by ArmSoM for open-source enthusiasts.

==== Installing RKDevTool
* RKDevTool is a dedicated USB burning tool for Rockchip, available on the Windows platform, which can be used to download system images to the product via the USB interface.

* After unzipping the package, you can use it without installation. Double-click RKDevTool.exe to enter the software interface.

* The software mainly has three sections: Download Image (burn image by address), Upgrade Firmware, and Advanced Functions.

==== Burning Image in MASKROM/Loader Mode

This mode is suitable for products that have not yet been burned with a system or where the burned system is damaged and cannot run (suitable for all situations).

Open the RKDevTool burning tool and set the product to burn mode.

Entering Loader Mode

* 1. Prepare a Type-C cable for burning the image.
* 2. Disconnect all cables that might power the product, such as the power cable, USB cable, etc.
* 3. Use a Type-C cable to connect the product's OTG interface to a USB port on the computer, then open the RKDevTool software.

== Burning Debian System

=== Using a Card Reader to Burn to microSD

Installing SDDiskTool

To burn the image to eMMC, you need to use the SDDiskTool_version.exe tool.

Click the following link to access it: https://pan.baidu.com/share/init?surl=4qfAZM3QqgJPuFVjKRSBUw&pwd=arms[Baidu Cloud Link]

image::/bpi-aim7/docs_aim_7.png[docs_aim_7.png]

After extracting the compressed file, you can use the software without installation. Simply double-click the SD_Firmware_Tool.exe file to open the tool.

=== Burning the Image

Open the SDDiskTool executable file (SD_Firmware_Tool.exe) and insert the SD card.

First, select the correct SD card you want to burn. Then, set the function mode to SD Boot and choose the image you want to burn. Finally, click the "Create" button to start creating the bootable SD card.

image::/bpi-aim7/docs_aim_8.png[docs_aim_8.png]

Please be patient as the SD card is being burned. The larger the image, the longer the burning process will take.

NOTE: 1.If you encounter an error saying it cannot burn the image after clicking "Create," try closing the error window and starting the creation process again. If that doesnâ€™t work, try formatting the SD card. +
2.The firmware downloaded from Baidu Cloud must be extracted before it can be loaded. On a Windows PC, you need to run the tool with administrator privileges.

=== Using a USB Cable to Burn to eMMC

We will use the RKDevTool to burn the image and put the product into burning mode.

* 1. Prepare a Type-C cable for burning the image.
* 2. Disconnect all cables that might power the product, such as the power cord and USB cables.
* 3. Connect one end of the Type-C cable to the OTG port on the product and the other end to the USB port on the computer, then open the RKDevTool software.
* 4. Hold down the Recovery button and power the product using the DC supply.
* 5. Wait for the software to indicate that a LOADER device has been detected (as shown below), then release the button.
* 6. If unsuccessful, repeat steps 2-5.

image::/bpi-aim7/docs_aim_9.png[docs_aim_9.png]

= Interface Usage

== Debug Serial Port

Connect the USB to TTL serial cable as shown below:

image::/bpi-aim7/bpi-aim7-debug.png[bpi-aim7-debug.png]

[options="header",cols="1,1,1"]
|====
|AIM7	|Connection	|Serial Module
|GND (pin 11)	|--->	|GND
|RX (pin 3)	|--->|	TX
|TX (pin 4)	|--->|	RX
|====
== Ethernet Port
* First, plug one end of the Ethernet cable into the ArmSoM-AIMâ€™s Ethernet port and connect the other end to a router, ensuring the network is functional.
* After booting, the system will automatically assign an IP address to the Ethernet card via DHCP without any additional configuration.
* To check the IP address in the ArmSoM-AIM Linux system, use the following command:

```sh
root@armsom-aim7:/# ip a
1: lo: <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN group default qlen 1000
    link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00
    inet 127.0.0.1/8 scope host lo
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
    inet6 ::1/128 scope host
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
2: eth0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc mq state UP group default qlen 1000
    link/ether c2:ed:bc:48:3b:7a brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
    inet 192.168.10.106/24 brd 192.168.10.255 scope global dynamic noprefixroute eth0
       valid_lft 86396sec preferred_lft 86396sec
    inet6 fe80::7351:88a9:9b4c:11be/64 scope link noprefixroute
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
```

After the ArmSoM-AIM boots, there are three ways to check the IP address:

* Connect to an HDMI display, log into the system, and use the terminal to enter the ip a command.
* Use the debug serial port terminal to enter the ip a command to check the IP address.
* If there is no debug serial port or HDMI display, you can check the ArmSoM-AIMâ€™s IP address through the routerâ€™s management interface. However, this method often fails to display the ArmSoM-AIMâ€™s IP address. If not visible, follow these troubleshooting steps:
** First, check whether the Linux system has booted properly. If the ArmSoM-AIM's green LED is solid, it generally indicates a normal boot. If only the red LED is on, the system hasn't booted correctly.
** Ensure the Ethernet cable is securely connected, or try a different cable.
** Test with another router, as many issues arise from routers not assigning IP addresses correctly or assigning them but not displaying them in the management interface.
** If no alternative router is available, connect an HDMI display or use the debug serial port to check the IP address.

TIP: It is important to note that the ArmSoM-AIM automatically assigns an IP address via DHCP without any settings required.

Use the ping command to check network connectivity.

The command to test network connectivity is as follows. You can interrupt the ping command by using the Ctrl+C shortcut:

```sh
armsom@armsom-aim7:~$ ping www.baidu.com

* Use an HDMI cable to connect the ArmSoM-AIM to an HDMI display.
* If the HDMI display outputs an image after the Linux system boots, the HDMI interface is functioning properly.

TIP: Note that many laptops have HDMI ports that only support output functionality. This means they cannot display HDMI output from other devices on their screens. When attempting to connect the development board's HDMI to a laptop HDMI port, please confirm whether your laptop supports HDMI input functionality. If no display is shown, first check whether the system version includes a desktop environment, as server versions only show the terminal.

NOTE: The USB interface can be connected to a USB hub to expand the number of USB ports.

Connecting USB Mouse or Keyboard Test

* Plug a USB keyboard into the ArmSoM-AIM's USB port.
* Connect the ArmSoM-AIM to an HDMI display.
* If the mouse or keyboard operates normally within the system, the USB interface is functioning properly (note: the mouse works only in desktop versions).




NOTE: TROUBLESHOOTING BURNING FAILURES +
If you encounter a "Download Boot Fail" error or other errors during the burning process (as shown below), it is usually due to a poor USB connection, low-quality cables, or insufficient power from the computerâ€™s USB port. Try replacing the USB cable or using a different USB port on the computer to troubleshoot.

NOTE: WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MASKROM MODE AND LOADER MODE? +
Maskrom Mode: When the Flash is not yet burned with firmware, the chip will enter Maskrom mode for the initial firmware burning. During development, if the Loader mode fails to start properly, Maskrom mode can also be used to burn the firmware. +
Loader Mode: This mode is triggered during the uboot startup when a specific pin is pressed. In Loader mode, firmware burning and upgrading can be performed. You can also burn individual partition images for easier debugging.
