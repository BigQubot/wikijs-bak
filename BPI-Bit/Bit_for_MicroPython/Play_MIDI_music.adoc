= Music
We provide a MIDI playback function module, it can be specified on the buzzer PWM output, thus playing out music, although you may not need to know this.

Well, without further nonsense, click on music, the board has been pre-connected to a built-in buzzer, its pin position is 25.

A side note: don't install a piezoelectric buzzer. It only plays a single tone.

The code is as follows (refer to the Microbit documentation for the interface)
```sh
import music
music.play(music.NYAN)
```
You can see the following list, which is our built-in music.
