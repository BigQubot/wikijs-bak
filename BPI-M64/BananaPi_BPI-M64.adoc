= BPI-M64 Introduction

Banana Pi BPI-M64 is a 64-bit quad-core mini single board computer. It features 2GB of RAM and 8GB eMMC. It also has onboard WiFi and BT. On the ports side, the BPI-M64 has 2 USB A 2.0 ports, 1 USB OTG port, 1 HDMI port, 1 audio jack, and lastly a DC power port. The processor is pin-to-pin comptialbe with R18, so it comes with two versions: M64 and M64-R18.

Also being a member of the Banana Pi family, the M64 is a big jump from the octa-core BPI-M3. This is because this Banana Pi BPI is named after its 64-bit SoC. BPI-M64 will be reserved for an upcoming board

BPI-M64 is an open platform device, it is for anyone who wants to play and build with developer technology instead of simply using consumer technology. Backed by our community, starting a project and building servers is fun and rewarding. We welcome all companies, DIYers, and tech loving people within our community! Together, we can make a difference, we can discover our passions, inspire others, and build a practical project.
