=== Transfer files

==== scp

scp (secure copy) command in Linux system is used to copy file(s) between servers in a secure way. 

The SCP command or secure copy allows the secure transferring of files between the local host and the remote host or between two remote hosts. 

It uses the same authentication and security as it is used in the Secure Shell (SSH) protocol.

You can copy files from a Windows terminal to a Linux system on the same LAN. Just make sure the Open SSH client is turned on and can be viewed in Settings > Applications > Optional Features.

If you want to copy files from Windows systems to Linux systems, you also need to enable the Open SSH server.

image::/picture/bpi_m4_berry_mobaxterm_6.jpg[bpi_m4_berry_mobaxterm_6.jpg]

The scp command format is:

```bash
scp [optionals] file_source file_target
```

. `optionals` is an optional parameter, such as -r, which can be used to copy the entire directory recursively.

. file_source The file or directory to be copied.

. file_target will copy the past path and rename it if a specific file name is entered at the end.

Take copying local files from a Windows system to a Linux system as an example. In the Windows terminal, enter:
```cmd
PS D:\temp\temp_4> scp ".\hello.txt" pi@192.168.3.12:"/home/pi/Downloads/"
```

You can also copy files in the Linux system to the local computer in the Windows terminal:
