BPI-Wifi5 Router dual-band wireless router, 2.4G 2T2R, 5.8G 2T2R coexist at the same time. The use of four omni-directional high-gain antennas, with strong signal penetration and wider coverage, which makes the already strong signal more powerful, data transmission is also smoother. MU-MIMO multi-device transceiver technology has low latency and multiple devices are stably connected simultaneously, thus ensuring a good experience for multiple devices.

BPI-Wiﬁ5 Router adopts the national silicon chip SF19A2890S2 solution,   providing 1 gigabit WAN port and 3 gigabit LAN ports, supporting 2.4G and 5G, Its wireless transmission rate of 1200Mbps.
And it supports rich software features, providing the ideal high-performance  product for small and micro businesses and families.
